In particular, if the number of steps is too small then the algorithm will just exhibit random walk behavior, whereas if it is too large it will waste computations.\\n\\nHoffman & Gelman introduced NUTS or the No-U-Turn Sampler, an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps.  NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to find likely candidate points that automatically stops when it starts to double back and retrace its steps.  Empirically, NUTS perform at least as effciently as and sometimes more effciently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs.\\n\\nMoreover, Hoffman & Gelman derived a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging.

The distribution\\nis defined by 3 parameters: the index alpha, the lower and upper mass range\\nM_min, M_max.\\n\\n    theta = { alpha, M_min, M_max }\\n\\nLet\\'s presume known M_min and M_max such that we only look at the posterior of\\nalpha. We know that in fact M_max and M_min cannot be infered because they are\\nmost likely outside from the mass range covered by the data set.\\n\\n    dN/dM = Z x M ** -alpha\\nwhere\\n    Z = integral(dN/dM dM) over M_min, M_max\\n      = (1 - alpha) / (M_max ** (1 - alpha) - M_min ** (1 - alpha))\\n\\nwe define beta = 1 - alpha\\n    Z = beta / (M_max ** beta - M_min ** beta)\\n\\nFor this test, we neglect errors of stellar mass observations.\\n\\nLeast-square likelihood could be used in this case. However instead we can make\\nuse that the mass function is the PDF of our data. Thus, We can derive the likelihood as\\n\\n    L(data; alpha) = prod_k Z x M[k] ** alpha\\n\\nand because numerically more stable and usually makes the math simpler we\\ndefine the  log-likelhood lnL(Data; alpha) as\\n\\n    lnL(Data; alpha) = N ln(Z) - alpha * sum_k ln(M[k])\\n\\nNote that the data set only enters via D = sum_k ln(M[k]), term that is\\ncompletely independent of the fit parameter. Hence this term can be computed\\nonce and for all at beginning. Therefore, the length of the data set does not\\nslow down the computations. (This may not be true for non-perfectly known masses)\\n\\nThis experiment aims at implementing Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo method. This\\nmethod involves a stepsize as the traditional MH (Metropolis Hastings) method\\nbut improves efficiency by updating this value using the local gradient of the\\nobjective function lnL.\\n\\nHamiltonian Monte-Carlo makes use of the fact, that we can write our\\nlog-likelihood as an energy similarly to dynamic systems:\\n\\n    L = exp( ln(L) ) = exp( -E )\\n\\nSo that E = - ln(L) is the energy of any point in the parameter space.\\nMaximazing the likelihood becomes finding the minimum state of energy.\\nThe algorithm then uses Hamiltonian dynamics to modify the way how candidates\\nare proposed by computing the total energy of a local point by:\\n\\n    H = 1/2 * p ** 2 + E\\n\\nwhere p ** 2 is the impulse (movement between 2 steps)\\n\\np is proposed by doing random leap frog steps locally using the gradient of the\\nobjective function.\\n\\nIn our case the gradient function of the log-likelihood is:\\n\\n    d lnL / d theta = d lnL / d alpha\\n                    = -D -

      "The\n",
      " code you provided implements the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) algorithm\n",
      " for Bayesian inference. Here's a breakdown of how the sampling is done:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**1.  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) Foundation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Energy and Dynamics:** NUTS is built upon HMC, which uses\n",
      " concepts from classical mechanics. The target distribution (the probability distribution you want to sample from) is represented as an \"energy\" function.\n",
      "* **Gradient Information\n",
      ":** HMC leverages gradient information of the energy function to guide the sampling process. It simulates the motion of a particle in this energy landscape, using Hamiltonian dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.  NUTS Algorithm Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Initial Conditions\n",
      ":** The sampling starts with an initial guess of the parameters (theta0) and an initial step size (epsilon).\n",
      "* **Dual Averaging:** The step size is adaptively adjusted during a burn-in period (Madapt) using\n",
      " dual averaging, which aims to find an optimal step size that balances exploration and acceptance rate.\n",
      "* **Leap-Frog Integration:** The algorithm simulates Hamiltonian dynamics using the leap-frog integration method. This involves updating the particle's position (theta) and momentum (r) over a series of small steps.\n",
      "*\n",
      " **Tree Building:** The key innovation of NUTS is the \"tree building\" process. This recursive procedure explores the parameter space by building a binary tree, extending the trajectory of the particle both forwards and backwards in time.\n",
      "* **No-U-Turn Condition:** The tree building stops when the trajectory starts to retrace\n",
      " itself, preventing the sampler from getting stuck in local minima. This \"no-u-turn\" condition ensures efficient exploration of the target distribution.\n",
      "* **Acceptance Step:** At the end of each iteration, a Metropolis-Hastings step is used to decide whether to accept the proposed sample based on the change in energy\n",
      ".\n",
      "* **Sample Collection:** After the burn-in period, the sampler starts collecting samples, which are then used to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code Implementation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **`nuts6` Function:** This is the main function that implements the NUTS algorithm. It takes the target distribution\n",
      " (`f`), the number of samples (`M`), the number of burn-in steps (`Madapt`), the initial guess (`theta0`), the initial step size (`delta`), and whether to display progress (`progress`) as inputs.\n",
      "* **`build_tree` Function:** This is the recursive function that constructs the\n",
      " binary tree during each iteration. It explores the parameter space, stopping when the no-u-turn condition is met.\n",
      "* **`leapfrog` Function:** This function performs a single leap-frog integration step, updating the particle's position and momentum.\n",
      "* **`find_reasonable_epsilon` Function\n",
      ":** This heuristic function helps determine a reasonable initial step size.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The NUTS algorithm uses a combination of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and adaptive step size adjustment to efficiently explore and sample from a target distribution. The key feature of NUTS is its tree building process, which intelligently expands the sampling trajectory to avoid\n",
      " retracing steps and efficiently explore the parameter space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific part of the algorithm or code in more detail. \n",

Here the same is done using an example, where out of 4 registers, you need to measure only 2 qubits.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer\\n\\nq = QuantumRegister(4)\\n# we need only 2 classical bits as we are measuring only 2 qubits\\nc = ClassicalRegister(2)\\nqc = QuantumCircuit(q,c)\\n\\n# affecting the 2 qubits, that I am planning to measure\\nqc.h(q[0])\\nqc.x(q[3])\\n\\n# Measuring the first and last qubit only\\nqc.measure([0,3],[1,0])\\njob = execute(qc,Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'),shots=1000)\\ncounts = job.result().get_counts(qc)\\nprint(counts)\\n```\\n\\nThe above code results in \\n\\n```\\n{'01': 503, '11': 497}\\n```\\n\\nIn short, you need to provide the array of Qubits' indices that you want to measure in the first parameter of `qc.measure`. And also, don't make the mistake of declaring more classical registers than required.\\n\\n#### Why [1,0] as second parameter instead of  simply putting  `c`  ?\\n\\nIn classical bits, counting starts from the right. If there are 2 bits, say `10` , then `0` is the 0th bit and `1` is the 1st bit. Now if we provide simply `c`  as the second parameter in `qc.measure`, by default `q[0]` is mapped to the least significant bit - 0th bit(the right most bit). And that would result in output as `{'10': 503, '11': 497}` because the right  most bit(`q[0]`) gives 0 and 1 with nearly equal probability.\\n\\nThis leads to confusion because we passed `[0,3] ` in the first parameter and while reading the output we expect the outcome of `q[0]` to be on the left most side rather than the right most side. To avoid this confusion, we map the outcome of q[0] to the most significant bit, which is the right most classical bit - 1st bit in this case. \\n\\n**NOTE**: Alternatively you could pass [3,0] as first parameter and c as second parameter in `qc.measure`, but I didn't like the idea of disturbing the order of qubits.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Credits:\\n\\nIt was really frustrating for me, when I couldn't find how to do this on the google. Thanks to [Jack Woehr](https://github.com/jwoehr)  for helping me out with this thing in Qiskit slack.\\n\",\n",

       " '_posts/2022-02-01-genes-say-beautiful.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: is there anything inherently beautiful?\\nsubtitle: NO\\ndate: 2022-02-01\\ncategories: [random]\\n---\\n\\n## Height of Sexyness\\n\\nIn a TED talk titled *Cute, sexy, sweet, funny*, philosopher Daniel Dennett argues that we find certain things attractive because evolution trained us to get attracted to them due to survival benefit. For example, we are fond of sweet things like cakes because they contain sugar, which is Glucose and glucose is required for production of energy. Then he shows a picture of beach girls and says guys find girls like these attractive because that\\'s how they are programmed to. Over the course of evolution, we lost a lot of hair over the body. If that didn\\'t happen height of sexyness would be something like this.\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/weE4xT9.png)\\n\\n## What makes a beautiful things beautiful\\n\\nWhen you come across a beautiful face you can\\'t stop glaring at it. A beautiful face mesmerizes for reasons even you fully are not aware. Yet you appreciate the person with a sincere feeling. So, what makes a beautiful face beautiful?\\n\\nHere are some of the common explanations that you find on the web. \\n\\n- Symmetric face\\n- Prominent lower jaw\\n- Golden Ratio - Ratio of length and width of face should be around 1.6\\n\\nAlmost every time, we recognise a beautiful face with a single look. How the heck does one identify such subtle features of face or calculate the golden ratio just by a glance?  \\n\\n## A Body programmed by Gene\\n\\nWhen a ball is thrown at you, you don\\'t solve differential equations to find the trajectory of the ball or locate where your hand should be placed to catch the ball. Yet, you catch it with little or no difficulty without involving any maths. But if you had to build a machine to catch the ball, it would have to do the maths to catch the ball. So, this points out that human body is programmed to make such calculations without awareness. I am not arguing that you calculate velocity vectors of the ball every instant subconsciously! But evolution has *programmed* us to able to locate where you have to place your arm to hold the ball coming towards you. Something akin to solving differential equations is programmed by genes.\\n\\nUsing a similar argument, we can speculate that we have been programmed to find such features in face and get attracted to them. But why only these features?\\n\\n##  Because the Gene told so\\n\\nIt is the genes that have built us as their survival machines. Genes have programmed us with certain instructions that can enhance their chances of survival. Glucose is one of the molecules that is required for energy in human body. So, genes have programmed to us to get attracted to things like cake that contain glucose. \\n\\nGenes instruct by chemical process that involves breaking and making of proteins, which is very slow--in order of months. But to protect themselves from dangers present in external environment, one has to respond fast--in order of seconds. Hence genes have developed sensory system so that the survival machine can sense danger and protect itself. To make decisions in real time, genes have developed the nervous system which send information to different parts of the body via electrical impulses, which is much faster. Genes have **programmed instructions to the parts of survival machine that can be beneficial for their survival**. To quote Dawkins, *Genes are policy makers, brains are the executives*.\\n\\nReproduction is the only way genes are passed on from one generation to another. It is by reproduction that genes are capable of surviving for a long. Genes in the form of copies are passed on from parent to offspring. While reproduction, the genes of mother and father are \"mixed\" to give rise to offspring. So, it is important for genes survival to enter the body of a healthy offspring.  For that, choosing the appropriate mate is necessary. \\n\\nGuys are attracted to certain girls because genes have programmed so. It is on genes that have programmed us to get attracted to a face that is symmetric, prominent lower jaw or may be golden ratio. Why only these features? Because there has to be some survival benefit associated with such features.\\n\\nLooking good involves taking care of your body and being healthy<sup>1</sup>. So, if someone looks good that means she/he is taking care of her body(the survival machine of genes) well. The offspring of such a person is likely to have the same characteristics. So, it is profitable for genes to be in such a body, rather than someone who doesn\\'t work on maintaining the survival machine. Exercise has also been suggested to improve one\\'s attractiveness<sup>[2](https://www.leaf.tv/9427359/10-ways-exercise-makes-you-more-attractive/)</sup>. It means someone involved in physical labour might have developed such characteristics that attract mates. It is profitable to mate with such a physically strong partner, as they are capable of facing danger effectively. \\n\\nTo summarise, we have been trained to get attracted to faces of survival machines that have better chances of survival. Consider the question-why are girls attracted to guys that have a masculine personality? Masculine personality is a sign of strength, which means the survival machine is more capable of protecting themselves and hunt for food and their mates. Hence it is advantageous for the female to mate with a strong male as it increases her chances of survival.  Of course, we live in a modern era, where a girl a doesn\\'t need a man to protect her from predators or hunt for food. But what I am trying to argue that **genes have hard-wired us to get attracted to such people**. \\n\\nSo, next time you find a person beautiful, complement them they *have a evolutionarily attractive personality*. \\n\\n## Motive\\n\\nThere is a common tendency of people(including me) to treat beautiful people or things as special, as if they were made of celestial ether.  An appreciation, that is sincere and immense, comes out subconsciously for only one reason - the face. The point of this essay was to convince that there is nothing special about beautiful things and it is all play of genes. \\n\\nAlso, when a question like \\'why are beautiful things beautiful\\' is attempted to resolve from evolutionary perspective, it helps us realise that most of the time we do things the way we were hard wired to. To conclude, *there is no inherent beauty.* If you find something beautiful, ask the genes- why!\\n\\n## Sources\\n\\n1. Attractiveness and healthy\\n\\n   > In this view, the psychological mechanisms used to assess attractiveness should show evidence of design for identifying good mates (Thornhill & Gangestad 1999). For example, faces that look healthy should be perceived as attractive, and they are (Grammer & Thornhill 1994, Henderson & Anglin 2003, Jones et al. 2001, Kalick et al. 1998). However, such results could reflect a powerful attractiveness halo effect, whereby positive traits like health are indiscriminately attributed to attractive individuals.

Hence it would be better to try the task in a Virtual machine.\\nComing back to modules, to get the list of modules you can use the command `lsmod` . To get information about a specific module you can use `modinfo MODULE_NAME`\\n\\n### Make\\nIn linux, make is used to build executable programmes and libraries.\\nMakefile\\xa0 is a file that contains a list of instructions to build programmes and libraries in a particular syntax (in the background it utilizes the make hence its called a makefile)\\n\\nWhat is a build process:\\n- Compiler taking source code and converting to object files\\n- Linker taking the object files and converting them to executable\\n\\n### Syntax of makefile\\n```\\ntarget: dependencies\\n<tab> system_command\\n```\\nFor example \\n```\\nall:\\n    g++ main.cpp hello.cpp factorial.cpp -o hello\\n```\\nall is the default target for a make file. if no other target is specified, it will execute this target\\n\\nExample of target with no system commands(look at `all`),\\n```\\nall: hello\\n\\nhello: a.o b.o c.o\\n    g++ a.0 b.o c.o\\na.o: a.cpp\\n    g++ -c a.cpp\\nb.o: b.cpp\\n    g++ -c b.cpp\\nc.o: c.cpp\\n    g++ -c c.cpp\\nclean:\\n    rm -rf *.o\\n```\\nHere in case to execute all of them \\nyou can simple use make\\nto execute one specific target(useful in case when one file is changed)\\n```\\nmake target name\\n```\\nanother example to make things clear\\n```\\nall: hello\\n\\nhello: a b c\\n\\t@echo \"all\"\\na:\\n\\t@echo \"a\"\\nb: \\n\\t@echo \"b\"\\nc: \\n\\t@echo \"c\"\\nclean:\\n\\trm -rf *.o\\n```\\nIn the above example command make will print only \"all\" on the terminal\\ncommand `make a` will print only \"a\" on the terminal\\n\\nusing variable names in makefile\\nits as simple as assigning a variable and accessing using dollar notation\\nfor example\\n```\\nCC = gcc\\n```\\n$(CC) to use gcc\\n\\n### Kernel Debug level\\nThere are totally 8 levels of log in linux, from level0 to level7. The level7 is the debug level.\\n\\n\\n### Task\\n\\nThe C code which accomplishes the task: hello_world_module.c \\n```\\n#include <linux/module.h> // included for all kernel modules\\n#include <linux/kernel.h> // included for KERN_INFO\\n#include <linux/init.h>   // for the __init  and __exit macors\\n\\nMODULE_LICENSE(\"GPL\");\\nMODULE_AUTHOR(\"RKA\");\\nMODULE_DESCRIPTION(\"Accomplish Task 1\");\\n\\nstatic int __init hello_init(void) {\\n    printk(KERN_DEBUG \"Hello \\\\n\"); \\n    // since the challenge asks to print in the debug level\\n    return 0;\\n    // Non zero return implies module couldn\\'t load\\n}\\nstatic void __exit hello_cleanup(void) {\\n    printk(KERN_DEBUG \"Clean module\\\\n\");\\n}\\n\\nmodule_init(hello_init); // when module loads\\nmodule_exit(hello_cleanup); // when module unloadss\\n```\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\nAt the beginning the headers that required are included. Description in comments.\\nThe next three lines, give an info about the module. The info about the module can be obtained from the command line using modinfo MODULE_NAME\\n\\nThere are 2 static functions on that runs when module is loaded, and the other when module is unloaded.\\n\\n```\\nStatic function is a function that has scope limited to its object file. The advantage of this is that we can use the same name at different files, without any clashes.\\n```\\n\\nThe last two lines indicate what functions to be called on loading and unloading of the module. We can also see that here printk is used instead of printf, because we want it to print in the kernel logs.\\xa0 Also in\\xa0 printk function defines the log level to which it wants to print. Here since in the task, it is asked to print at debug level, KERN_DEBUG is the first argument.\\n\\nNow to build this module we need to write a makefile\\nhere is its code:Makefile\\n```\\nobj-m += hello_world_module.o\\nall:\\n    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules\\nclean:\\n     make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean\\n```\\n\\nThe first line is called the goal definition. It indicates what files need to be built\\nRun the makefile by typing make  in the terminal. We get a list of different files. We need the `.ko`  file. By loading a kernel module means we are inserting this `.ko` file in the kernel \\n\\nNow to insert the hello_world_module.c (To make it ready to convert into a .ko file)\\n```\\nsudo insmod hello_world_module.ko\\n```\\nVerify that you have inserted the module\\n\\nYou can do this by using the dmesg ,which print the kernel log\\nAlso you can check the log file whose path is /var/log/kern.log\\n\\nTo remove the module, the comand `sudo rmmod  MODULE_NAME` can be used.\\nTo verify that you have removed a module, you can check using the dmesg command or verify the kern.log file\\n\\n**NOTE**: Suppose you are getting an error like \\'Operation not permitted\\'.  It is due to the fact we are trying a module which is not signed. In generally modules are signed, which are like proof the module is a valid one. You can either manually sign the module by yourself or you can simply turn off the secure boot to add unsigned modules in your kernel. You can also see the kernel logs that there is a entry which says \\'module verification failed\\'\\n\\n### References:\\n- http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/\\n- https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile\\n- https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txtm',\n",

       " '_posts/2021-04-18-on-what-2-laugh.md': \"---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: On what to laugh?\\nsubtitle: My framework to decide what is funny and what is not\\ndate: 2021-04-18\\ncategories: [random]\\n---\\n\\nIt happened to me several times, that I share a funny joke(funny according to me) with my friends and they get offended. This makes me feel guilty. Since, then I always used to wonder if there is any framework to decide if a joke is funny for everyone. When things like space and time are relative, how can you decide if something is funny or not absolutely?\\n\\nBut after reflecting on this, I came up with a small framework to decide if something is to be considered as a joke or taken seriously.  When someone doesn't laugh on the joke I share, I don't feel guilty if my framework decide its funny! I feel bad for them, that they take things too seriously in life. So here are the only two rules that I follow:\\n\\n1.  **Jokes that are invariant of the person involved**: Though, space and time are relative, the Lorentz Invariant is same for all observers. Similarly, in some funny incidents, the humor is invariant of the person involved. For example, when a person walking suddenly slips and falls down and you find it funny, it is because the incident is funny. You would have still laughed if there was another person who had faced the same tragedy! So, there is nothing wrong in laughing. Funny incidents happen and we all should share the joy. In fact, if I were the person who slipped I would still laugh on myself. But again, it depends on how serious the incident is. But here I am only concerned about the small and silly things.\\n2. **The joke is about a set of people, who chose where they belong**: People sometimes don't laugh because they feel the joke hurts a certain set of people. In that case, ask the question does the set to which people belong a conscious choice of their own. For example, if there is a joke criticizing Flat earth people, I enjoy it completely. The flat earth idea is something people chose to believe consciously despite of the overwhelming evidence that it is not. But if someone made a joke on short people(like me) or tall people, that's not funny! No one consciously chooses their height. In simpler words, if the categorization is done by nature without the person's conscious will, it is not right to joke.\\n\\nIt is silly to take humor this seriously, but I guess it happens when you watch funny videos and memes too much. Making jokes that offend minimum number of people is an art according to me. If you are someone, who believes the same, you will enjoy works of artists like [Bhuvan Bam](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqwUrj10mAEsqezcItqvwEw), [RSM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjV6TXJ8YTIule0-IyrmY-Q) and [Ryan George](https://www.youtube.com/user/RyGeor).\\n\",\n",

This will allow you to include non-posts related content to be published on the landing page under a dedicated heading. *We recommended that you title this section with a Heading2 (`##`)*.\\n\\nUsually the `site.title` itself would suffice as the implicit \\'main-title\\' for a landing-page. But, if your landing-page would like a heading to be explicitly displayed, then simply define a `title` variable in the document\\'s front matter and it will be rendered with an `<h1>` tag.\\n\\n##### *Post Listing*\\n\\nThis section is optional from Minima v2.2 onwards.<br/>\\nIt will be automatically included only when your site contains one or more valid posts or drafts (if the site is configured to `show_drafts`).\\n\\nThe title for this section is `Posts` by default and rendered with an `<h2>` tag. You can customize this heading by defining a `list_title` variable in the document\\'s front matter.\\n\\n\\n### Includes\\n\\nRefers to snippets of code within the `_includes` directory that can be inserted in multiple layouts (and another include-file as well) within the same theme-gem.\\n\\n  - `disqus_comments.html` &mdash; Code to markup disqus comment box.\\n  - `footer.html` &mdash; Defines the site\\'s footer section.\\n  - `google-analytics.html` &mdash; Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).\\n  - `head.html` &mdash; Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.\\n  - `custom-head.html` &mdash; Placeholder to allow users to add more metadata to `<head />`.\\n  - `header.html` &mdash; Defines the site\\'s main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.\\n  - `social.html` &mdash; Renders social-media icons based on the `minima:social_links` data in the config file.\\n\\n\\n### Sass\\n\\nRefers to `.scss` files within the `_sass` directory that define the theme\\'s styles.\\n\\n  - `minima/skins/classic.scss` &mdash; The \"classic\" skin of the theme. *Used by default.*\\n  - `minima/initialize.scss` &mdash; A component that defines the theme\\'s *skin-agnostic* variable defaults and sass partials.\\n    It imports the following components (in the following order):\\n    - `minima/custom-variables.scss` &mdash; A hook that allows overriding variable defaults and mixins. (*Note: Cannot override styles*)\\n    - `minima/_base.scss` &mdash; Sass partial for resets and defines base styles for various HTML elements.\\n    - `minima/_layout.scss` &mdash; Sass partial that defines the visual style for various layouts.\\n    - `minima/custom-styles.scss` &mdash; A hook that allows overriding styles defined above. (*Note: Cannot override variables*)\\n\\nRefer the [skins](#skins) section for more details.\\n\\n\\n### Assets\\n\\nRefers to various asset files within the `assets` directory.\\n\\n  - `assets/css/style.scss` &mdash; Imports sass files from within the `_sass` directory and gets processed into the theme\\'s\\n    stylesheet: `assets/css/styles.css`.\\n  - `assets/minima-social-icons.svg` &mdash; A composite SVG file comprised of *symbols* related to various social-media icons.\\n    This file is used as-is without any processing. Refer [section on social networks](#social-networks) for its usage.\\n\\n\\n### Plugins\\n\\nMinima comes with [`jekyll-seo-tag`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) plugin preinstalled to make sure your website gets the most useful meta tags. See [usage](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag#usage) to know how to set it up.\\n\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nHave the following line in your config file:\\n\\n```yaml\\ntheme: minima\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Customizing templates\\n\\nTo override the default structure and style of minima, simply create the concerned directory at the root of your site, copy the file you wish to customize to that directory, and then edit the file.\\ne.g., to override the [`_includes/head.html `](_includes/head.html) file to specify a custom style path, create an `_includes` directory, copy `_includes/head.html` from minima gem folder to `<yoursite>/_includes` and start editing that file.\\n\\nThe site\\'s default CSS has now moved to a new place within the gem itself, [`assets/css/style.scss`](assets/css/style.scss).\\n\\nIn Minima 3.0, if you only need to customize the colors of the theme, refer to the subsequent section on skins. To have your\\n*CSS overrides* in sync with upstream changes released in future versions, you can collect all your overrides for the Sass\\nvariables and mixins inside a sass file placed at `_sass/minima/custom-variables.scss` and all other overrides inside a sass file\\nplaced at path `_sass/minima/custom.scss`.\\n\\nYou need not maintain entire partial(s) at the site\\'s source just to override a few styles. However, your stylesheet\\'s primary\\nsource (`assets/css/style.scss`) should contain the following:\\n\\n  - Front matter dashes at the very beginning (can be empty).\\n  - Directive to import a skin.\\n  - Directive to import the base styles (automatically loads overrides when available).\\n\\nTherefore, your `assets/css/style.scss` should contain the following at minimum:\\n\\n```sass\\n---\\n---\\n\\n@import \"minima/skins/{{ site.minima.skin | default: \\'classic\\' }}\";\\n@import \"minima/initialize\";\\n```\\n\\n#### Skins\\n\\nMinima 3.0 supports defining and switching between multiple color-palettes (or *skins*).\\n\\n```\\n.\\n├── minima.scss\\n└── minima\\n    └── _syntax-highlighting.scss\\n```\\n\\n\\nA skin is a Sass file placed in the directory `_sass/minima/skins` and it defines the variable defaults related to the \"color\"\\naspect of the theme. It also embeds the Sass rules related to syntax-highlighting since that is primarily related to color and\\nhas to be adjusted in harmony with the current skin.\\n\\nThe default color palette for Minima is defined within `_sass/minima/skins/classic.scss`. To switch to another available skin,\\nsimply declare it in the site\\'s config file. For example, to activate `_sass/minima/skins/dark.scss` as the skin, the setting\\nwould be:\\n\\n```yaml\\nminima:\\n  skin: dark\\n```\\n\\nAs part of the migration to support skins, some existing Sass variables have been retired and some **have been redefined** as\\nsummarized in the following table:\\n\\nMinima 2.0      | Minima 3.0\\n--------------- | ----------\\n`$brand-color`  | `$link-base-color`\\n`$grey-*`       | `$brand-*`\\n`$orange-color` | *has been removed*\\n\\n##### Available skins\\n\\n- classic\\n- dark\\n- solarized\\n- solarized-dark\\n\\n### Customize navigation links\\n\\nThis allows you to set which pages you want to appear in the navigation area and configure order of the links.\\n\\nFor instance, to only link to the `about` and the `portfolio` page, add the following to your `_config.yml`:\\n\\n```yaml\\nheader_pages:\\n  - about.md\\n  - portfolio.md\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Change default date format\\n\\nYou can change the default date format by specifying `site.minima.date_format`\\nin `_config.yml`.\\n\\n```\\n# Minima date format\\n# refer to http://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/date/ if you want to customize this\\nminima:\\n  date_format: \"%b %-d, %Y\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Extending the `<head />`\\n\\nYou can *add* custom metadata to the `<head />` of your layouts by creating a file `_includes/custom-head.html` in your source directory. For example, to add favicons:\\n\\n1. Head over to [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to add your own favicons.\\n2. [Customize](#customization) default `_includes/custom-head.html` in your source directory and insert the given code snippet.\\n\\n\\n### Enabling comments (via Disqus)\\n\\nOptionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.\\n\\nTo enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:\\n\\n```yaml\\n  disqus:\\n    shortname: my_disqus_shortname\\n```\\n\\nYou can find out more about Disqus\\' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname).\\n\\nComments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post\\'s YAML Front Matter.\\n\\n:warning: `url`, e.g. `https://example.com`, must be set in you config file for Disqus to work.\\n\\n### Author Metadata\\n\\nFrom `Minima-3.0` onwards, `site.author` is expected to be a mapping of attributes instead of a simple scalar value:\\n\\n```yaml\\nauthor:\\n  name: John Smith\\n  email: \"john.smith@foobar.com\"\\n```\\n\\nTo migrate existing metadata, update your config file and any reference to the object in your layouts and includes as summarized below:\\n\\nMinima 2.x    | Minima 3.0\\n------------- | -------------------\\n`site.author` | `site.author.name`\\n`site.email`  | `site.author.email`\\n\\n\\n### Social networks\\n\\nYou can add links to the accounts you have on other sites, with respective icon, by adding one or more of the following options in your config.\\nFrom `Minima-3.0` onwards, the usernames are to be nested under `minima.social_links`, with the keys being simply the social-network\\'s name:\\n\\n```yaml\\nminima:\\n  social_links:\\n    twitter: jekyllrb\\n    github: jekyll\\n    stackoverflow: \"11111\"\\n    dribbble: jekyll\\n    facebook: jekyll\\n    flickr: jekyll\\n    instagram: jekyll\\n    linkedin: jekyll\\n    pinterest: jekyll\\n    telegram: jekyll\\n    microdotblog: jekyll\\n    keybase: jekyll\\n\\n    mastodon:\\n     - username: jekyll\\n       instance: example.com\\n     - username: jekyll2\\n       instance: example.com\\n\\n    gitlab:\\n     - username: jekyll\\n       instance: example.com\\n     - username: jekyll2\\n       instance: example.com\\n\\n    youtube: jekyll\\n    youtube_channel: UC8CXR0-3I70i1tfPg1PAE1g\\n    youtube_channel_name: CloudCannon\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Enabling Google Analytics\\n\\nTo enable Google Analytics, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:\\n\\n```yaml\\n  google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N\\n```\\n\\nGoogle Analytics will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`\\n\\n### Enabling Excerpts on the Home Page\\n\\nTo display post-excerpts on the Home Page, simply add the following to your `_config.yml`:\\n\\n```yaml\\nshow_excerpts: true\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/jekyll/minima.

He dismisses conventional questions like *where are you from*, *how are you are*, as they are less fruitful.  Questions like *what book have you read recently*, *what cool thing have you learnt recently* might also not be good questions as not everyone reads regularly and not everyone would have a cool answer. \\n\\nHe proposes the question - *What have you been thinking lately* for several good reasons. The answer could be about anything - a book, movie, hobby, job, idea, class, relationship. Another good reason that I particularly liked was that it gives a message that thinking about thinking is a fundamental activity for humans. He adds that this question captures a person's essence, as a person's thoughts are always his/her own. \\n\\nI do agree with that. But generally, a lot of thoughts occupy our minds. Ask asking a person to recollect one on the spot might be difficult and may lead to the person speaking out a random uninteresting thought out of pressure. Also, if the person is going through a difficult phase of life, he might have spent a lot of time thinking about his problems. In that case, reminding someone of their problems is not a good idea. So, I propose a similar and a more direct question - *What is the most exciting thing that you have come across recently?* Here the answer could be a book, a new thing the person tried, a new experience, a new show or movie watched.  By using the word *exciting* we bring out the stuff, which people love enough to share. Also, the person doesn't have to put any effort in recollecting as exciting things are likely to be in the cache of our brains.\\n\\nSo, what is the most exciting thing that you have come across recently?\\n\\n## Post Scriptum\\n\\n- Aaron's blog - [The Smalltalk Question](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/smalltalkq)\\n- I summarised a few of Aaron's blogs [here](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-06-11-aaronblogs/)\\n- The question can also serve well in a [Lean Coffee session - agenda less structured meetings](https://leancoffee.org/).

       " '_posts/2021-05-20-types-yt.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Types of Science YouTubers\\nsubtitle: \\ndate: 2021-05-20\\nmathjax: true\\ncategories: [random]\\n---\\n\\nOver the last 8 months, I have been exploring Physics. And I have explored and learnt most of the things from YouTube videos. The topics include Linear Algebra, basics of Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and many more. I was greatly amazed by the way YouTubers deliver the content, and how most of the learning becomes fun. The enthusiasm of fellow learners is reflected in the comment section of the videos and in sub-reddit posts. YouTube has been a great platform for people with great teaching skills and knowledge make a huge impact. In this blog, I wish to talk types of Science YouTubers and their role in an individual\\'s learning, like mine.\\n\\nObviously, the classification is not a strict one. There are YouTubers, which belong to both category. But I am mentioning the examples, based on the majority of the videos, that I have watched. Basically, you can consider it as a classification of Science YouTube videos rather than Science YouTubers.\\n\\n## 1. Amazing Summarizers\\n\\nThere are many topics outside which are difficult to grasp when you read them or hear it in a lecture. This type of YouTubers summarize it in a well understandable way, with cool animations and helpful analogies. They save a lot of time. Things that we understand by re-reading different articles can be understood simply by watching their videos. Some of the amazing Summarizers are [Up and Atom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSIvk78tK2TiviLQn4fSHaw), [Arvin Ash](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpMcsdZf2KkAnfmxiq2MfMQ) and [PBS Space Time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g). It is from these videos, that one gets a broader understanding of topic and most importantly, it establishes curiosity in one\\'s mind. Because, by very nature the aim of these videos is to let audience be aware of new and amazing things in the field. Anyone can watch and enjoy them. Mostly, these videos don\\'t assume any background. \\n\\nThese videos serve the role of introducing a topic in an exciting and interesting way. If you are lucky enough that one of such videos is recommended by YouTube\\'s algorithm, do watch it! It might be beginning of amazing journey of learning something new.\\n\\n## 2. Valuable Insight Providers\\n\\nThere are some niche topics, which have a very dry explanation in the academic textbooks or might be boring when we hear them in a lecture. But sometimes these topics turn out to be of great importance(eg Fourier Transform, Gradients, Linear Algebra). Proper understanding of these topics  is essential to learn other important topics in Science. It is here that our Valuable insight providers come to rescue. As I have put the name, these YouTubers provide a valuable insight that is rarely found in most of the conventional resources. Sometimes, I am amazed on how these YouTubers come up with these insights! Mostly, it seems to me that their insight is a result of their past experience or thorough knowledge in the field. \\n\\nFor example, consider Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform is an algorithm of great importance. But sometimes, it is just introduced as a tool to shift basis. Hardly, any intuition is provided in most of the resources. I am sure, you will be amazed on watching the [3blue1brown\\'s video on Fourier Transform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY).  Explaining Fourier Transform with the idea of winding a wave in a circle and locating it\\'s center of mass, wow! The video is also visually pleasing to watch. More than Fourier Transform, what excited me the most was Linear Algebra playlist by 3blue1brown.  I still don\\'t know from where Grant got the idea that a 2x2 matrix can correspond to a Linear transformation, and how the linear transformation can be visualized on a 2D plane and the idea that 2x2 matrix can be thought as 2 \"new\" basis vectors stacked side by side, but it is amazing! I have noticed the effectiveness of this explanation personally. Previously, if I wanted to perform transformations after changing basis, I would try to recollect the formula like $JAJ^-1$ or something similar(I don\\'t even remember what the terms mean!). But after few months, when I was faced with such a problem of applying transformations alongside changing basis, I couldn\\'t recollect the formula. So, I tried solving the problem from first principles, instead of bothering about formula and what is given in the question. And, I had solved it  by using the basic idea that a 2x2 matrix corresponds to Linear Transformation. It was an amazing moment for me! ([here](https://i.imgur.com/rvi3dII.png) is a pic from my assignment)\\n\\nAnother YouTube channel, who provides valuable insight is Nick\\'s channel Science Asylum. The channel is filled with Physics videos, where Nick provides an amazing insight into some of the most confusing and misunderstood topics. For example, the uncertainty principle. At first, to a beginner it sounds as if its a technological limitation which is the cause of uncertainty. But when you dig deep, one understands, that it is inevitable due to probabilistic nature of Quantum Mechanics. Nick explains that really well in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skPI-BhohR8), with nearly no mathematics!\\n\\nIt is from these YouTubers, that we learn to appreciate the beauty in subtleties of Science. \\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nSo, we have YouTubers, who can introduce to a new topic and create enough interest in you to explore more. And there are YouTubers to help you out with understanding of Niche topics and provide beautiful insights, which help you keep your learning journey exciting. So, what do we need more?\\n\\nI am greatly intrigued by the book - Peak by Andres Ericsson, the famous book on expertise. The book introduces the idea of deliberate practice, a form of practice which includes - specific goals, focused attention, getting a feedback, pushing out of comfort zone.  Once someone has learnt a topic from YouTube, there should be some platform, where the learner can test his/her understanding. MIT OCW understands it well. They open source the assignments along with the Tests too, so that the learner gets a feedback of his/her understanding. It is very common in Science to feel that you have understood the topic after watching a lecture or a video. But to make sure, if one has really understood the topic or just has become familiar with the terms, a feedback system is necessary. Some good resources like [QCVC - Quantum Computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc) and  [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) have included Questions periodically to help learners to test their understanding. In future, I hope that more learning resources will come up, where feedback systems are embedded implicitly.(Something like this maybe - [Universe in Problems](http://universeinproblems.com/index.php/Main_Page#About)) \\n\\nIn this era, where conventional resources, mostly focus on feeding information to the learner, we are lucky to have YouTube and other Free Open platforms on web, which provide a great value to independent learners and curious people.\\n',\n",

It is a dark book, compared to the rest. While Brave New World by Aldous Huxley felt more of a utopian world with the ideas like *everyone belongs to everyone else* and *soma*. The book conveys the idea that *there is more to life than immediate gratification of the senses*. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, out of all three, was a bit difficult to read due to excessive usage of literary devices. The book is about the *moronic influence of mass media* and the irreplaceable importance of books, walking and talking. \\n\\nThese books have been popular for decades and will continue to be popular. What makes these books stand out is not just ideas well ahead of their time, but also the writing. Orwell and Huxley, ideas and writing of these two men have strong potential to leave a thumbprint in the ridges of reader's mind.\\n\\nThe aim of a dystopian novel is to take an idea to the extreme and depict the human conditions. While each book had different ideas to convey, the common theme of the books encourages one to find common patterns. \\n\\n## 1. Spectrum of Orthodoxy\\n\\nIn such extreme conditions, you will have a spectrum of characters exhibiting different behaviour. On one extreme, you have a character that moves through the system as fish through water. On the other extreme, a character that attempts to ponder the meaning of things around him. \\n\\n1984 spectrum\\n\\n> Parsons... Syme....Julia...Winston\\n\\nBrave New World\\n\\n> Lenina....Bertrand...Helmoltz....................................................John\\n\\n(I think John has to be on a different scale)\\n\\nFahrenheit 451\\n\\n> Mildered....Faber...Montag\\n\\n## 2. The guy who knows it!\\n\\nIn all three books, there is a character who is well aware of the extreme conditions in which they live, yet they believe that this is how the system should be. These are not men who follow the system blindly but are the ones who have the upper hand and ensure that system doesn't break. In 1984, it was O'Brien. In Brave New World, it was Mustafa Mond. In Fahrenheit 451, it was Beatty. There is at least one conversation between the protagonist and such a character to reveal the intentions of the government and convince him that the prevailing system is best for humanity(with an exception of 1984, where party does it for sake of itself).\\n\\n## Language and Books\\n\\nAnyone who has spent enough time with books understands the influence language can have on one's thoughts and emotions. Writers know it best. In each book, it has been shown how books and language can shape thoughts. In 1984, the government tries to limit one's thoughts via a new language *Newspeak*. In Brave New World, John's clarity on his emotions gets amplified when he reads Shakespeare. Fahrenheit 451 is a book about books. Conversation between Faber and Montag greatly depicts why books are important.\\n\\n## Favourite Quotes from each book\\n\\n1984\\n\\n> Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing\\n\\nBrave New World\\n\\n> the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was **not the maintenance of well-being**, but **some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge**\\n\\nFahrenheit 451\\n\\n> Good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her to flies.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '_posts/2023-08-10-context-and-relevance.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle:  \"Context or Relevance can make literature engaging\"\\nsubtitle: \"Hacks to appreciate classic literature\"\\ndate:   2023-09-03\\ntags: random\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I read classic books, occasionally I fail to appreciate some of them. I used to wonder- what made this book so popular? I felt I needed more command on language and subtle aspects of writing to appreciate the work. Lately I realised that one can appreciate classics without mastering these complexities. Context of the book or relevance of literature might be sufficient to appreciate a classic in a non-expert way.\\n\\nRecently, I came across a [Literature podcast](https://www.historyofliterature.com/532-crime-and-punishment-by-fyodor-dostoevsky/) about the history of crime and punishment. Crime and Punishment is a book one can appreciate superficially also. It has a great story and drama. A newbie could appreciate Dostoevsky\\'s masterful dissection of a man\\'s thoughts. But after hearing the podcast, I learned that Dostoevsky had read such articles in newspapers where young men committed crimes because they considered themselves to be superior over others. The podcast also talked about story of Leopold and Lob who committed a murder because they believed they were Ãœbermensch, a superhuman concept in Nietzsche\\'s philosophy. All of this information, gave a new perspective on Crime and Punishment\\'s story and ideas.\\n\\nBut many forewords fail to setup a proper context. Most of them end up speaking about the book as a whole and appreciate author\\'s writing style. In such cases, relevance of literature to one\\'s life or events can help you to appreciate literature. Good writers use events and characters of a story to convey an idea about human nature. When you find a character or event or a dialogue bear a great resemblance to a part of your life, that is when the book, in Kafka\\'s words, acts as frozen axe within the sea. I initially saw \\'Notes from Underground\\' as a story of a hyper-conscious man. But when I re-read and started finding resemblances to \"a man who gains happiness from tooth-ache\". Such a man is no more an abstract concept in a book, but someone whom I can find in daily life. \\n\\nFeynman noted that art, unlike science, is subjective; there\\'s no right or wrong. So, it is a likely thing that one can get an interpretation of the story which the author didn\\'t intend to convey. Fahrenheit 451 written by Ray Bradbury was misinterpreted by many as a book about censorship. But the author himself claims that it is not about that \"I wasn\\'t worried about freedom, I was worried about people being turned into morons by TV. Fahrenheit\\'s not about censorship, it\\'s about the moronic influence of popular culture through local TV news, the proliferation of giant screens and the bombardment of factoids([ref](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27821/did-ray-bradbury-ever-claim-that-fahrenheit-451-was-not-about-censorship/27823#27823))\" So, how can one be sure that one\\'s interpretation of the book is same as what the author intended? Talking to people and reading online can diversify your opinions and check your interpretation. But that doesn\\'t matter, for *art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable!*\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n ',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-07-07-protocols-vs-platforms.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: At what level does Centralization appear?\\nsubtitle: A discussion on Protocols vs Platforms\\ndate: 2021-07-07\\ncategories: [random]\\n---\\n\\n(Note that I have used the word Protocol loosely. But hopefully, the distinction between a platform built by a single company and rules created by a individual/community are clear)\\n\\nI always use to wonder about this -- Internet, the massive connection of computers all over the world is decentralized in nature. World Wide Web, a service on the internet, which helps us exchange documents is also decentralized. Then why are successful applications on the web Google, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit are centralized? Is it something because at the highest level centralization works well?\\n\\nThe key difference one must realize is that Internet, World Wide Web are fundamentally Protocols. While, Google, YouTube, Reddit are platforms.  Internet can be fundamentally boiled down to TCP/IP(Transmission Control **Protcol**, Internet **Protocol**). Web can be boiled to the Documents that are written in HTML standard and those are transfered via HTTP(Hypertext Transfer **Protocol**).  The right Protocols have the power to scale in a decentralized way.\\n\\nWhy is decentralization important? Because, by its fundamental nature there is no one with a central power who can abuse it. We have seen enough problems, when single corporations have too much power. And the best part about decentralization is since they are just open standards, anyone can be part of it. There is no single point of failure. Then immediately one may ask, aren\\'t there any Protocols for social communication on the internet? \\n\\nWell there is one, which has survived the test of time - the email. Fundamentally, it can be boiled down to Protocols like SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer **Protocol**), POP3, IMAP. We just use clients run by companies like Google(gmail), Yahoo(yahoomail), Microsoft(outlook). Because not everybody can run their own server to implement the protocol. Not just for one to one communication, there was also \"Usenet\" in the early days for multiple users to come together and discuss on topics of similar interest. Think of it as Reddit, except that volunteers used to run their own servers. Later, Usenet died! Have you seen anyone using it in the recent years?\\n\\nThe protocols are free, but where do the servers that run the protocol come from. The volunteers who ran their own Usenet servers had to shut down because they had no incentive to run. Also, it takes a lot of time and effort for individuals to maintain the servers. Large companies have both resources and incentive to do the same(they run ads). Apart from that, to make changes or improvements, it would be faster for a single company to decide and implement them. Hence the centralized platforms were becoming better with nice UX and more features at a faster rate. On the other hand, if its a protocol, there is a need for wide range volunteers come to an agreement. Hence ever smaller changes would take long time. In short, Centralized platforms grew better quickly than decentralized Protocols like Usenet. \\n\\n*Ideas, information and Knowledge can be replicated infinitely without any cost. But physical resources like a CPU are limited. There is an economic barrier!*\\n\\nWell, the hopes are not yet thrashed. We now see that it is possible to have a currency with a completely decentralized protocol. I am talking about Bitcoin(and other cryptocurrencies). Bitcoin can also be regarded as a protocol, where each individual is a server. Such systems are called peer-to-peer systems. In near future, one can expect new decentralized protocols in similar fashion to become popular.\\n\\n## Works that are going on currently in the direction\\n\\n- [Aether](https://aether.app/about/) is a peer to peer network, which is completely serverless\\n- [Bluesky](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242718/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-media-team-project-update), twitter\\'s decentralized social network\\n\\nIf these ideas interest you, I recommend you read the essay - [Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech). This article inspired Jack to start the Bluesky project.([Jack Dorsey\\'s tweet](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766087281172480) regarding the same) \\n\\n',\n",

While reading, I occasionally take down notes in `evernote`. But they are mostly irregualar and unstructured.\\nI just made notes of points, which I felt important or liked exteremely. Going through this will only give you a rough idea of what\\'s inside the book.\\nAt many places, I have not changed the lines from the book, so as to not reduce the impact!\\n\\n### Introduction\\nBrilliant thinking is rare. But courage is in shorter supply than genius. Progress in vertical direction when you do new things. Globalisation should be accompanies with technological advancements. If you try to achieve more with same old strategies it is possible that you might create an unsustainable future.\\nExample producing more electrical energy with old methods that create pollution. Some new and innovative thinking needs to be introduced to achieve more in a sustainable manner\\n\\nIts hard to blame people for dancing when the music is playing around (Refering to the dot com boom that resulted in the crash.People were excited so much about building companies on internet and investors were so exhuberant that they invested tons of money without caring out the plans and statergy of the company. A lot was learnt from the dot com crash!)\\n\\nThe most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.\\n\\nif you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated\\ncommodity business.\\n\\n### All happy companies are different \\nIf a company manages to become a successful monopoly, it is because it has been able to solve a problem creatively which no one else in the past. If a company fails then it is because it could not face the competition. Because in a competition markets decide the price, and you need to sell at that price to get your products sold and consequently, you will make minimal profits.\\n\\n### Competition is bad\\nPeople do the same thing over and over resulting in no good.\\nIf you are less sensitive to social cues,\\xa0 you are less likely to do the same things everyone is doing around\\nIf you’re interested in making things\\nor programming computers, you’ll be less afraid to pursue those activities\\nsingle-mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them.\\nFighting\\xa0 for getting too personal is bad and it makes no sense \\nBecause in the process you are focusing on beating your rival but not on your product\\nExample Informix head was busy in making bill boards and adds to target Larry(Oracle\\'s founder) rather than focusing on better products\\nIf you cant defeat then merge -\\xa0Musk\\'s X.com and PayPal\\n\\n(An unconventional insight on competition)\\n\\n### Building a Monopoly\\nA great business is defined by amount of cash flow it can generate in future. Investors expect Twitter will be able to capture\\nmonopoly profits over the next decade, while newspapers’ monopoly days are\\nover(Twitter vs Times).\\nSimply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it\\nwill make in the future. (To properly value a business, you also have to discount\\nthose future cash flows to their present worth, since a given amount of money\\ntoday is worth more than the same amount in the future.)\\nConventional Business tend to have a high revenue in the beginning. But as time passes the cash flows began to fall because of new players entry in the market\\nits opposite to the tech companies. Initially they may have a low cash flow. But as time passes, a valuable product is being built at the company hence achieves max cash flow in future rather than immediately\\nHence it is advised for entrepreneurs to not focus on short term goals like weekly active users , monthly reports etc. The most important question to ask is\\xa0 \"will the business be around a decade from now\"\\nThe answer to the above question requires you to look more than numbers and think critically about qualitative\\xa0\\xa0characteristics of your business\\n\\n### Characteristics of Monopoly\\n1. **Proprietary technology:**\\nTech that is at least 10 times better than its closest substitute. Google Search engine feature. Amazon\\'s ability to be able to become the largest book store, that no physical book store could actually store and compete.\\n\\n2. **Network Effects:**\\nLarge number of people should be able to use your product. The strange thing is\\nsuch products should always start with a small number of users initially. Example Mark\\'s Facebook.\\n\\n\\n3. **Economies of scale:**\\nThe startup should be able to grow quickly soon. It is possible if different components of product are built at different places. \\n\\n4. **Branding:** \\nDoing this with superior tech, like apple having its own hardware and software. While this said, a company cannot be built on basis of brand alone. The product should always be at the top of the list.\\n\\n### Building a monopoly\\nIn the beginning stage of your startup, you must target a small niche market. because it is easier to get attention of a small group of people who need your product than large group of people with scattered attentions. \\nExpand after you have won your small targeted market. Example, Amazon first focussed on book readers initially and reached great success. Then after a point Amazon had 2 options - reaching to more number of people with books, delivering more than books\\nIt chose the second \\nDon\\'t focus on disruption. The idea of disruption the existing technology is exciting. But you must focus on the beautiful process of creating something new. Avoid competition as much as possible.\\n\\n### The last will be the best \\nBeing at the first can help you to acquire a large share of the market, but it is\\xa0 possible that someone else comes up and unseats you. Being first should only be a tactic but not a goal. So to succeed you must study the endgame before anything else\\n\\n### You are not a lottery ticket\\nWhen successful people mention luck, they are being strategically humble. Ralph Emerson quote\\n\"Shallow men believe in luck,\\nbelieve in circumstances.... Strong men believe in cause and effect\"\\n\\n### Can u control your future\\nThere are 2 kinds of people \\npeople who believe that future is \\n1. definite \\n2. indefinite\\n\\nThose who believe its definite make plans in the present work on its execution\\nthe \"indefinite\" ones give up on planning.\\n\\n*Going furthur...*\\n1. Indefinite Pessimists: Those who see a bleak in future and do nothing to make it better. Just hope\\n2. Definite Pessimists: Those who see bleak and prepare for it\\n3. Definite optimists: Those who take big/good ideas seriously and work on it\\n4. Indefinite optimists: Those who take a conventional path to make their life happy rather than planning and trying out a new things\\nSince the regular paths have worked for our generations, they don\\'t see it as a way that it would fail for the next upcoming and pass on this ideology rather than\\xa0 a process oriented carrier that is open for options by trying out several things. \\n\\n### The issues with the three \\n- Definite pessimism works by building what\\ncan be copied without expecting anything new\\n- Indefinite pessimism works\\nbecause it’s self-fulfilling: if you’re a slacker with low expectations, they’ll\\nprobably be met. \\n- But indefinite optimism seems inherently unsustainable: how\\ncan the future get better if no one plans for it?\\n\\nAs per Darwin\\'s theory adapting to the surroundings is the best way to survival. Build some MVP and iterate your ways to success, build it like people wants.\\xa0 it helps u reach local maxima but not global maxima. Darwinism may be a fine theory in other\\ncontexts, but in startups, intelligent design works best.\\n\\n### More on definite optimism\\nThrough careful design and planning you can change the world rather than listening to feedback of small group of people,\\nWhen Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006,\\nI thought we should at least consider it. But Mark Zuckerberg walked into the\\nboard meeting and announced: “Okay, guys, this is just a formality, it shouldn’t\\ntake more than 10 minutes. We’re obviously not going to sell here.” Mark saw\\nwhere he could take the company, and Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a good\\ndefinite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future\\nas random.\\n\\n### VCs investment\\nVCs should invest a huge sum of money in a handful of companies rather than diversifying. The judgement should be made on basis of unique fundamentals of the company and should not shift to financial questions ! The idea is to see the 80 20 rule. Maximise the investment in 20% of companies that produces the 80 % of profits.\\n\\n### Secrets \\nWhat valuable company is nobody building\\nThe answer to the such questions is not a convention, it means it is not an easy one. On the contrary its not also an impossible one. The answer is just \"secret\", finding it is hard, but doable.\\nWhy people don\\'t put effort in finding answers to the secrets and working towards them is mainly because of \\n- incrementalism: people believe and are taught to grow step by step hence they don\\'t tend to think big or try working towards it\\n- risk averse: people are too afraid of taking risk. The prospect of being lonely but right—dedicating your life to something that no one else believes in—is already hard.\\n- complacency: People are satisfied with what they achieve at a certain stage\\n- Doubt that why hasn\\'t anyone else done this previously. If others can\\'t then how can I ?\\nSecrets are hard. But sometimes require an elementary insight which has been proved in case of \\n  - Airbnb: connecting travellers and rental owners\\n  - Uber: connecting people who drive and want to move \\n  - Facebook: connecting people\\n\\nIf insights that look so elementary\\nin retrospect can support important and valuable businesses, there must remain\\nmany great companies still to start.\\n\\n### Where to look for secrets\\nPlace where no one else is looking. Most people think only in terms of what they’ve been taught; schooling itself aims to impart\\nconventional wisdom. So you might ask: are there any fields that matter but\\nhaven’t been standardised and institutionalised?\\n\\n### A note on founders \\nWhen you start something, the first and most crucial decision you make is\\nwhom to start it with. Choosing a co-founder is like getting married, and\\nfounder conflict is just as ugly as divorce.\\nNow when I consider investing in a startup, I study the founding teams.\\nTechnical abilities and complementary skill sets matter, but how well the\\nfounders know each other and how well they work together matter just as\\nmuch. Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together\\n—otherwise they’re just rolling dice.\\nTheiel\\'s Law: *\"A\\xa0startup\\xa0messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed\"*\\n\\n### Cash is NOT the king\\nA CEO must always try to pay as less as possible to himself\\n**Story of Aaron levie**: Aaron Levie, the CEO\\nof Box, was always careful to pay himself less than everyone else in the\\ncompany—four years after he started Box, he was still living two blocks away\\nfrom HQ in a one-bedroom apartment with no furniture except a mattress.\\nEvery employee noticed his obvious commitment to the company’s mission and\\nemulated it.\\n\\n### Vested interests\\nYou can offer your employees more than salary-equity. \\nBut it must be taken care to whom you offer. Sometimes it happens that large equity is offered to those who joined the start up early than those who join late but provide great value. So you need to be careful while providing equity to people. Some people are not interested in equity, rather they would prefer regular salary. It is because equity makes sense only if the company is profitable. People who show interest in owning part of company than being paid in cash\\xa0 reveal interest and commitment toward\\'s company\\'s future \\n\\n### Extending the foundation\\nBob Dylan has said that he who is not busy being born is busy dying.\\nThe founding moment of a company,however, really does happen just once.\\nThis leads to a second, less obvious\\nunderstanding of the founding: it lasts as long as a company is creating new\\nthings, and it ends when creation stops. If you get the founding moment right,\\nyou can do more than create a valuable company\\n\\n### Recruiting\\nWhy would someone\\njoin your company as its 20th engineer when she could go work at Google for more\\nmoney and more prestige?\\nThe best answer to the above question is different for different companies as it would depend on the mission of the company and about the team.\\nYou probably can’t be the Google of 2014 in terms of\\ncompensation or perks, but you can be like the Google of 1999 if you already\\nhave good answers about your mission and team\\n\\n### Doing one thing\\nOn inside , every individual should be sharply distinguished by her work.\\nEvery employee should be assigned one thing to work on and would be evaluated on that. This helps to avoid conflicts. Conflicts happen because the roles are fluid and people compete for the same responsibilities. By clearly defining the roles you ensure smooth functioning.\\n\\n### Importance of Sales\\nThe engineer’s grail is a product great enough that “it sells itself.” But\\nanyone who would actually say this about a real product must be lying: either\\nhe’s delusional (lying to himself) or he’s selling something (and thereby\\ncontradicting himself). If you’ve invented something new but\\nyou haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business—no\\nmatter how good the product\\n\\n### Technology and its complimentary nature to Humans\\nGlobalisation which includes supply of labour at cheap cost is a concern, because it leads to substitution.\\xa0 While technology on the other hand, is complementary. Machines can do tasks faster while cannot make simplest of decisions that a child can, So with proper use of man machine synergy, we can experience rapid growth and solve great problems\\nConsider linkedin, linkedin didn\\'t try to automate the process of recruit. To recruit a candidate, you have to scrutinise applicants\\' history and effectiveness. So linkedin just offered a platform to connect. Search\\xa0 and filtering job related opportunities with a powerful network made linkedin successful. \\nThe question you should be asking is not how humans will replace computers, the question is how computers will help humans solve hard problems\\n\\n### The questions to be asked\\n1. **The Engineering Question:**\\nCan you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental\\nimprovements?\\n(Is it 10X better than the existing solutions. If not people might not show interest to buy it because they have been habituated to the old one. So to get the market, you need to be far better)\\n2. **The Timing Question:**\\nIs now the right time to start your particular business?\\n3. **The Monopoly Question:**\\nAre you starting with a big share of a small market?\\n4. **The People Question:**\\nDo you have the right team?\\n5. **The Distribution Question:**\\nDo you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?\\n6. **The Durability Question:**\\nWill your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?\\n(Sometimes it might happen that there might be an already strong player in the market that might defeat you easily, no matter how good you are. For example, green tech companies in USA couldn\\'t compete with Chinese players as they had produced at a very low cost. It went on to a stage where these companies filed a suit against the Chinese companies. See that you predict and plan before hand. Here the entrepreneurs could have asked \"what will stop China from wiping out\\nmy business?\")\\n7. **The Secret Question:**\\nHave you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?\\n. Great companies have secrets: specific reasons for success that other\\npeople don’t see.\\n\\n### Failure of the most clean tech startups , yet an another buble\\nClean tech gave people a way to be optimistic about the future of energy. But\\nwhen indefinitely optimistic investors betting on the general idea of green\\nenergy funded clean tech companies that lacked specific business plans, the\\nresult was a bubble.\\nThe 1990s had one big idea: the internet is going to be big. But too many\\ninternet companies had exactly that same idea and no others. An entrepreneur\\ncan’t benefit from macro-scale insight unless his own plans begin at the micro-\\nscale. Clean tech companies faced the same problem\\n\\n### Founder\\'s paradox\\nConsider the example of Apple, Steve Jobs, the co founder brought great success to the company in the initial stages of life. But when he was fired, it was about to go bankrupt. But later, when Jobs was back when they were about to sell the company, he introduced the most revolutionary products - ipod, iphone and ipad.\\nThe lesson for business is that we need founders. If anything, we should be\\nmore tolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme; we need unusual\\nindividuals to lead companies beyond mere incrementalism.\\nAbove all, don’t overestimate your own power as an individual. Founders are\\nimportant not because they are the only ones whose work has value, but rather\\nbecause a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his\\ncompany.\\n\\n### The Future ?\\nMany have predicted that the future is to be great. And yes it might be true. \\nBut no matter how many trends can be traced, the future won’t happen on its\\nown. What the Singularity would look like matters less than the stark choice we\\nface today between the two most likely scenarios: nothing or something. It’s up\\nto us. We cannot take for granted that the future will be better, and that means\\nwe need to work to create it today.\\nOur task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will\\nmake the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential\\nfirst step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and\\nstrange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and\\npreserve it for the future.\\n',\n",

A hypnopaedic lesson that none of the readers will forget and wish if this were true:\\n\\n> Everyone belongs to everyone else\\n\\nConcepts like family, responsibilities, relationship, commitments don't exist in Brave New World, which reduces half the complexities and troubles of human life. Of course these are some of the beautiful things we experience, but things that even cause slight inconvenience are got rid of in BNW. \\n\\n**Work**: Humans are not simple animals. Simple in the sense that just food, sleep and sex won't suffice for human life. We want something in our life that fills our time when we don't eat, sleep or have sex. That's why we work! A large period of our life goes in training and finding the right kind of work. Even after such a long toil, many aren't satisfied with their jobs. BNW eliminates such problems by caste system, assigning tasks from their birth itself. Different castes - Alphas, Betas, Deltas, Epsilons. In fact, people are manufactured for certain tasks. They control the conditions of embryos and also condition humans to like their task, so that they keep doing it all their lives. \\n\\n> *All conditioning aims at making people like their unescapble social destiny*.\\n\\nHumans don't have to struggle on deciding what to do and how to do things. There is one thing that you are asked to do, and you are hard-wired to do it! Where is the room for problem?\\n\\n**Chemical Pleasure**: At the end of the day, it is the physio-chemical process that govern our mind. If anything goes wrong, there is always *soma*. Taking a gram of it teleports you to a different world making you forget all harsh truths of reality.\\n\\n> A gramme is better than a damn\\n\\nApart from the basic needs like food, clothing, shelter, the resident of BNW is satisfied with his sexual desires uncurbed, a work that gives a feeling of fulfilment at the end of the day. And if anything goes wrong, *soma* is the backup. But is that all what is needed to make a man happy? Huxley believes its not and this opinion is expressed in Mustafa Mond's thoughts:\\n\\n>  the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was **not the maintenance of well-being**, but **some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge**\\n\\nBertrand Marx's behaviour reflects this idea in simpler form. Marx doesn't like sex as a recreation. He hates it when Henry talks about Lenina as though *she were a piece of meat*. Inspite of the uncomfortable feeling that he feels all the time, he refuses to take soma. As he states, \\n\\n> I’d rather be myself, myself and nasty. Not somebody else, however jolly\\n\\nAnother such unorthodox character is of Helmholtz's. Helmholtz's writing background helps him to think about meaning of things rather than indulge in immediate gratifications. Helmholtz is happy without taking *soma* for a long periods and doesn't have sex as frequently as other conventional people. I guess that is what Huxley tried to convey via characters like Bertrand and Helmholtz that *life has meaning beyond the play of senses and that immediate gratification will never be enough*.\\n\\nEveryone has their own definition of happiness. People pursuit their own madness in order to be happy. The inconvenient and exhausting quest for things that make you happy contribute to the happiness. BNW residents don't get to experience that all.\\n\\n> What fun it would be if one didn't have to think about happiness\\n\\n## Books shape thoughts and thought processes\\n\\nWhen John is introduced to Shakespeare's works, his perception and thoughts grow rich. His clarity on his own emotions is amplified though he couldn't fully doesn't understand the words. \\n\\n> What did the words exactly mean? He only half knew. But **their magic was strong and went on rumbling in his head**, and somehow it was as though he had never really hated Popé before; never really hated him because he had never been able to say how much he hated him. **But now he had these words, these words like drums and singing and magic**. These words and the strange, strange story out of which they were taken **they gave him a reason for hating Popé; and they made his hatred more real**; they even made Popé himself more real\\n\\nThis scene depicts the magical power of language and books. Reading books introduces you to new set of perceptions and ideas that are limited by one's experience. As Faber tells in Fahrenheit 451, one of the unique feature of books is the *quality of information* present in them-*telling detail* about life. *Good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her to flies.*\\n\\n## The Ending\\n\\nThe book depicts two extreme ideas. On one hand, we have the world state's idea of social stability and the other hand we have John's idea of religious and orthodox life. The ending, in my opinion is meant to depict that both these extreme ideas are not suitable for man. Marx and Helmholtz are sent to a island, where with like minded intellectuals they can pursue their own interests. John, on the other hand ends up committing suicide. When a journalist asked Huxley whether his ultimate sympathies were with savage's aspirations or with ideal of conditioned stability, he replied\\n\\n> With neither, but I believe some mean between two is both desirable and possible and must be our objective\\n\\n## Some damn good lines\\n\\n> One of the principal functions of friends is to suffer(in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but unable to inflict upon your enemies\\n\\nWhen Savage betrays Bernard by not coming to the party, Bernard is insulted by everyone in the party. This line depicts the pain and frustration of Bernard had to undergo due to John's friendship.\\n\\n> Christianity without tears, that's what soma is\\n\\nSuffering is an inevitable part of life. The aim of religion is to provide man the necessary moral training to withstand the suffering. But this is a long process that involves pain and effort. Instead, soma helps to face such harsh realities of life by avoiding them.\\n\\n>  Men and women must have their adrenals simulated from time to time\\n\\nJohn argues with Mustafa that there is something exciting about facing uncertainty in life and living dangerously. Mustafa agrees to it that such a feeling has to be present and mentions about *Violent Passion Surrogate(V.P.S)*, a medical treatment where the body is flooded with Adrenaline providing the physiological equivalent of fear and rage. In BNW, all important human emotions like happiness, tolerance, fear, rage are caused artificially.\\n\\n> Happiness is a hard master if one isn't conditioned to accept it unquestionably\\n\\n> You have to choose between happiness and what we call high art. We’ve sacrificed the high art. We have the feelies and the scent organ instead\\n\\nLines taken from the epic debate between Mustafa Mond and John.\\n\\n> Huxley was fascinated by the fact that 'the same person is simultaneously a mass of atoms, a physiology, a mind, an object with shape that can be painted, a cog in the economic machine, a voter, a lover etc.'\\n\\nA line taken from the section introducing Aldous Huxley.\\n\\n## Post Scriptum\\n\\n- I feel Huxley is a unique author because his writing contains perfect mixture of elements from literature, philosophy and science. As a writer, Huxley's aim was to '*arrive technically at a perfect fusion of novel and essay*'.\\n- *life has meaning beyond the play of senses and that immediate gratification will never be enough* is phrase extracted from Margaret Atwood's foreword to the book.\\n\",\n",
       " '_posts/2021-11-23-chaos-review.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: I read Chaos by James Gleick\\nsubtitle: \\ndate: 2021-11-23\\ncategories: [books]\\n---\\n\\nThe book explains the development of Non-Linear dynamics in different fields of science from a historical perspective. You might have heard of the Butterfly effect - a butterfly flapping its wings could cause a tornado at a distant place. It is a metaphorical example of what physicists call *sensitive dependence on initial conditions*. It means that with a slight variation in the initial condition, the system would behave completely in a different manner. This is more evident in the example of double pendulums. A double pendulum consists of 2 pendulums, where the tail of the second pendulum is attached to the bob of the first pendulum. Take 2 double pendulums. Start making them oscillate at the same time with nearly same initial angle. A difference of 0.5 degrees. You notice that both the double pendulums oscillate in sync till a certain period of time but later, they start behaving completely different. Just a difference of 0.5 degrees caused the large difference in behaviour in pendulums over time. Such systems fall under the category of non-linear systems.\\n\\n A catchy alternate word for \"non-linear\" is *chaos*. The book does a wonderful job of exploring chaotic systems in different fields to a non-technical reader. But I think this book should also be read by people who know Non-Linear dynamics well. The superficial discussions might bore a technically equipped reader. But the story behind each discovery is worth knowing. The field of Chaos is relatively new(quantum mechanics and General Relativity are comparatively older).  The book covers the resistance the pioneers of the field had to face. It requires courage and originality to work in a field that hasn\\'t been established yet and the path is uncertain. Stories of Lorenz, Feigenbaum, Robert Shaw, Mandelbrot and many other pioneers of Chaos are both interesting and inspiring for anyone who wants to understand the development of a new groundbreaking field in science.\\n\\nOne of the key reasons Chaos developed late was the advancement of computers. It is through computers, that we could visualise chaotic behaviour of different systems and study them. Leonard Mlodinow in his book *Feynman\\'s Rainbow* mentions that he didn\\'t like the computer approach of solving since it was like getting results from a black box and they would not provide any understanding. This is kind of true. When equations become too complex to solve analytically, we make assumptions to simplify the equations to solve them(assumptions like a particular term being small, making the equation linear for a small period of time). The assumptions will help you to understand the system to a certain extent. But you can\\'t get far with those assumptions. In such cases, computers are indispensable. As I read the book, I realised the key role computers had played in the development of the field. In fact, arguably the first paper on Chaos by Edward Lorenz was possible from the results of a computer.\\n\\nA good motivation to learn about chaos would be its universality. Chaotic systems are ubiquitous. Turbulent flow of fluids, Neurons, Signals sent to heart, ecological systems, epidemics, financial markets, snowflakes, weather, so on and so on. It is interesting to learn what seems like completely different systems may have in common. A chaotist(non-linear dynamicist?) can use his/her methods to study almost any system by acquiring a bit of required domain knowledge.  \\n\\nSo folks who appreciate non-linear dynamics, folks who are interested in knowing more in breadth and little depth about chaos, folks interested in learning historical developments of a new field in science. Pick up the book!\\n\\n[Chaos: The Science of the Butterfly Effect video by Veritasium](https://youtu.be/fDek6cYijxI) can be considered as a trailer to the book\\n\\n## Watch more about Chaos\\n\\n- [Logistic map - Chaos in Ecological systems](https://youtu.be/ovJcsL7vyrk)\\n- [Turbulence - Chaos in Fluid dynamics](https://youtu.be/5zI9sG3pjVU)\\n- [Complexity Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6s-1TYa-1fBrUUIGijshCQ) Courses - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZI4edcv_uY&list=PLF0b3ThojznQwpDEClMZmHssMsuPnQxZT),[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MizhVorgywY&list=PLF0b3ThojznQ9xUDm-EbgFAnzdbeDVuSz)\\n- [Newton\\'s Fractal](https://youtu.be/-RdOwhmqP5s) \\n\\nThere are many good videos for different topics mentioned in the book.

A field\\'s medallist and a pioneer who helped the field of chaos grow. Smale bridged the gap between mathematicians and physicists in the field of Non-Linear dynamics. He also helped establish a campaign against the Vietnam war.  Read Smale\\'s short biography [here](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-Smale).\\n',\n",

There is a great pleasure in scribbling your thoughts on the paper, underlining sentences, talking to the author in the margins. But after you have read the book what do you do with it? Like many, I wanted to keep a nice book collection in my room. Showing it to my guests the wonderful books that I have read and talk about them. The book collection adds a intellectual or artistic touch to your room.\\n\\nOne day I came across a post in `r/books` titled \\n\\n> *My mom died in the UK and has nearly 4000 books. What's the best way to get rid of them, how can I sell them?*  \\n\\nMeaninglessness of life, Randomness of events, Human mortality; having these at the back of your mind can help you avoid doing things that only have superficial value. When you remind yourself that you will die, you realise that there is no point in hoarding things. Books have the immense potential to change an individual's perspective on life, ideas and thoughts. The only way I felt a book can serve its full potential, is to **give the book to someone who can appreciate the book, and ask them to do the same.** In this way, you can make sure that book is being read by someone and hopefully enjoying the book. It is tempting to keep the book as a memory, but remember what will be its fate when you are gone. As Steve Jobs mentioned in Stanford Commencement speech\\n\\n> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.\\n\\nWhen you love a book, you want it to *sting and bite* other people the way it did to you, so that you share the same mysterious beautiful feeling. But there is also a chance that your message might not be passed on and someone in the chain might attempt to hoard it. The best one can do to prevent such treachery is to leave a message at the end of the book that goes something like this.\\n\\n![message at end of book](https://imgur.com/mAE5JJn.png)\\n\\n*A message I left on the last page of 1984 novel*\\n\\n## Post Scriptum\\n\\n- Another noble thing that can be done is to donate the book to a library. But the book might have to wait for a long time in the shelf to be picked up.  A good side effect of giving the book in person is you introduce new books to people. There is also a chance of developing a readers' circle in your vicinity\\n\\n- Of course, you don't have to give away all the books that you have read. There is always at least one book that you might have planned to re-read  occasionally to grasp it completely, to extract all the juice out of it. (For me that book is *Godel, Escher, Bach*)  \\n\\n- The phrase *sting and bite* was taken from Kafka's quote\\n\\n  > Altogether, I think we ought to read only books that bite and sting us. If the book we are reading doesn’t shake us awake like a blow to the skull, why bother reading it in the first place? So that it can make us happy, as you put it? Good God, we’d be just as happy if we had no books at all; books that make us happy we could, in a pinch, also write ourselves. What we need are books that hit us like a most painful misfortune, like the death of someone we loved more than we love ourselves, that make us feel as though we had been banished to the woods, far from any human presence, like suicide. A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us. That is what I believe.\\n\\n- [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/q4he9f/my_mom_died_in_the_uk_and_has_nearly_4000_books/) to the Reddit Post\\n\\n- [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc) to Steve Jobs Stanford Commencement Speech.

       " 'readings.md': '---\\r\\nlayout: page\\r\\ntitle: Readings\\r\\npermalink: /readings/\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Dune Messiah by Frank Herbert\\r\\n\\r\\nThis book was hard to read. At many places, it is wordy and vague. Online forums  were [Jagurutu](http://www.jacurutu.com/index.php?sid=6960afbf721ee245f1fc5b27530f224e) were a great aid. I am still frustrated by the fact that fantasy elements like *prescience* have played a major role in key parts of a **\"sci-fi\"** book. Yet, I will continue with the next part because I have more questions that   haven\\'t been answered. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Why we die by Venki Ramakrishnan\\r\\n\\r\\nI picked this book because I loved Venki\\'s first book- The Gene Machine. This book repeatedly proves the point that a good writing on an unfamiliar topic is much more enjoyable bad writing on a exciting topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book can be considered as a crash course in cell biology. The author explains different causes of aging and death at the level of activities that go wrong within a cell - accumulation of waste, too many misfolded proteins, DNA damage etc. Even though you are not enthusiastic about biological details, Venki\\'s writing spurs great interest. I believe it is due to these 2 pedagogical techiques:\\r\\n\\r\\na) Explaining from a historical perspective. Venki doesn\\'t just drop you that this fact about cell exists and was discovered by so and so scientist. He walks through all the key discoveries in chronological order that led to it. This narrative helps narrator think about the ideas in a more organised way. This should be a lesson taught to every teacher - find a way to put ideas in the students\\' head in a organised way instead of shooting with facts. (But a more fundamental reason for many bad teachers is not that this a secret they are yet to discover, but because they themselves lack clarity in the subject)\\r\\n\\r\\nb) Einstein once said \"*Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler*\". Once Venki explains a point. He adds a couple of sentences more to emphasise the important point. He sometimes simplifies it, for example, \"improve life expectancy faster than age\" is followed by \"life expectancy increases by more than year annually.\" Or he puts a useful analogy to daily life objects.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the above, Venki makes the last but one paragraph of each chapter as a concise summary of the present chapter and the last paragraph gives you an direction of next chapter. Each chapter begins with small personal story    before embarking on complex cellular details discussion. Such good writing preserves the human side of details filled science. \\r\\n\\r\\n[Chris Olah once mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzJigelnRBE) that reason there is friction that complex ideas are difficult to communicate from writer to the reader is that in his/her working memory, the writer has the context set, which the reader lacks. Good writers realise this cognitive load and they try to make the road smoother for reader instead of diverting them to a messy shortcut.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother quality that makes this book qualify as an good book is provides a new perspective for an outsider in the field. As you read along, one develops a perspective of how processes inside the tiny cell has consequences for what we see and experience as ageing(Douglas Hofstadter provides such a perspective on about consciousness and neurons). Irrespective of your interest in biology, if you enjoy good writing and have an interesting understanding details of life, pick this book.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Dune by Frank Herbert\\r\\n\\r\\nPicked this book after watching the movies(Part-1,2) and this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26GPaMoeiu4), where Herbert tells that his book tries to convey a message about the dangers of charismatic leaders. As I read the book, I felt great appreciation for Denis V. for cutting down parts and making necessary changes to adapt the book for the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the book is labelled as science fiction, the aspect of \"prescience\" makes it feel like a fantasy book which I avoid. However, it seems that Herbert was inspired by the idea of Laplace\\'s demon - a creature that knew everything about individual atoms and physical laws and hence could calculate the future. At one point, I convinced myself that Spice could heighten abilities like making such absurd amount of computation in human beings that have evolved after thousands of years.\\r\\n\\r\\nReading a book after watching the movie suppress the thrill because you already know what is going to happen(\"*prescience*\"). Nevertheless, I had to read this book to read the next part so that I get the interesting message that Herbert wanted to convey.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How to Change your Mind by Michael Pollan\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting topic for people in psychology is \"altered state of mind.\" Accounts of it in diseased states are explored well in Oliver Sacks\\' *Hallucinations*. Aldous Huxley\\'s *Doors of Perception* is one of the best personal accounts of achieving an altered state through a substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this book, Pollan covers the literature of Psychedelics in all 3 aspects - historic, scientific, personal accounts. In historical part, he discusses different psychedelic substances were discovered, how scientists saw the potential to cure mental health diseases or over death anxiety in terminally ill patients with these, how some people saw it as a way to unlock human potential and elevate human society. Lastly, how one man(Timothy Leary) could be held responsible for these substances becoming anti-culture. A laudable thing about Pollan is that his writing covers different aspects of an argument(like it was not Leary\\'s fault completely!). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the scientific part, Pollan explores the neural correlates of psychedelics\\' famous effect  ego-death. The other fascinating part of this book is author\\'s personal trips on different substances. In each of his trip, he sees his family emotions amplified and you come across funny things like watching the hollow mask illusion while high.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have read Huxley\\'s Doors of Perception, this book should be definitely on your list!\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Hitchiker\\'s guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reading experience would have been much more fun if I wasn\\'t aware of the best parts of the book like planet\\'s destruction, 42 and Heart of Gold. A short book worth reading. A couple of disappointments - a)at places, complex sci-fi words were used without much explanation b)I feel there are jokes in the book require a peculiar thought process to understand them. Such jokes are hard to appreciate without any hint given to the reader. For example, see the [digital watches joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/63i028/douglas_adams_the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy/).    \\r\\n\\r\\n## Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy\\r\\n\\r\\nAn overrated classic. The book has a natural storyline depicting the inner conflicts of a woman(probably narcissistic?) who ends up in an affair. But there are several long pieces of text, that had zero contribution to the story and hamper the reading experience. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Genius Makers by Cade Metz\\r\\n\\r\\nIdeas that change the course of history mostly face an early resistance from the community. It requires huge intellectual courage to work on the ideas at a time, when majority in the field find it silly and unpromising. James Gleick captures one such narrative in his book \"Chaos\", chronicling the  evolution of Non-Linear dynamics. Genius Makers by Cade Metz is another such book. A book about the rise of AI, more specifically deep learning. Starting from Rosenblatt\\'s perceptron to Google\\'s BERT Language model, the book covers historic moments in the field of AI and stories of people behind it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that books like these are not just about technologies and ideas, but also the people behind them. It is interesting to see how the big names in the field had started their journey that was so different what they would achieve. As we are being bombarded with AI achievements, I think it is the right time to read this book before a sequel comes out. (This book doesn\\'t have anything about GPT!) \\r\\n\\r\\n## A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff Hawkins is an entrepreneur-turned-self-taught neuroscientist, who built a company named \"Numenta\" to understand the workings of neocortex, the component of our brain responsible for higher cognitive tasks. He wrote \\'A thousand brains\\' book to explain his work and ideas about the neocortex to the general public. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the first half of this book has many bold ideas, I found myself sceptical of them as they lacked experimental evidence. Although Jeff and his colleagues have produced journal papers to support their work, those papers provide a computational model built on basis of their ideas. I am not against computational model work, but with a play of parameters and many assumptions can lead to a model that aligns with researcher\\'s expectations but not objective reality.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that a genuine testament to a theory\\'s validity lies either in experimental evidence or its tangible application. A good example of the latter is ChatGPT. You don\\'t need any benchmark tests to show that the billion parameter model is good. People buy it and use it in their day-to-day life because it adds value. It is useful!. In Ilya Sutskever\\'s works, *usefulness is the best metric*.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter half of the book contains interesting futuristic discussions about preserving human knowledge and extraterrestrial communication. Hawkins suggests some new ideas humans might convey a message in space, that other forms of life can decipher. While I came for the brain theories, I liked this part of the book!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Double by Fyodor Dostoevsky\\r\\n\\r\\nA short story written by Dostoevsky three years before his exile. While I have always been an admirer of Dostoevsky\\'s work, I didn\\'t enjoy this one. The events surround protagonist\\'s double and story\\'s conclusion were hard to reconcile. The writing style contrasts from his other popular works like Notes from Underground, where Dostoevsky masterfully dissects a man\\'s thoughts. I felt \\'The Double\\' lacked that. Maybe this one requires a re-reading to get a clearer perspective, but I feel like revisiting \"Notes from underground\" to experience the Dostoevsky I cherish.  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Gene Machine by Venki Ramakrishnan\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book chronicles the journey of Venki Ramakrishnan from a graduate student in theoretical physics to a Nobel Prize-winning Ribosome structural biologist. This book is an essential reading for anyone involved in research for two  reasons. Firstly, it offers valuable insights into the inner workings of effective scientific research, including the work culture at MRC London Institute (home to 12 Nobel laureates, including Watson and Crick), the significance of an enthusiastic work environment, and how top researchers select their problems to work on, as well as the role of luck. Secondly, as a personal account of Ramakrishnan\\'s journey, the book exposes the insecurities that even the best researchers face, making it relatable and reassuring for others in the field. Although the book contains substantial structural biology content, readers from diverse backgrounds will still be able to appreciate and enjoy the narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always been captivated by the diverse experiences that the human brain can generate, and this book offers a plethora of such instances. On a personal level, this book has reinforced my belief that ultimately the underlying physiology dictates an individualâ€™s experiences and behaviours. Full blog post [here](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2023-05-08-Hallucinations-review/)\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Elephant in the Brain by Simler and Hanson\\r\\n\\r\\nThis book can be summarized with the quote - *A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and a real reason.* The book talks about the hidden motives behind our actions. Hidden motives as in not just unknown to other people, but also to you(your consciousness). Through evolution, our brains have learnt to deceive ourselves before deceiving others. This is perfect for survival because if you are unaware of it, then you won\\'t express it and your real selfish motive will remain hidden. Any Freud fan would surely be attracted to such an idea that explores the unconscious side of the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis first part of this book does a great job in explaining how such a self-deception came into existence and why it is necessary for survival. The second part of the book explore implications of this idea in large scale institutions like Education, Politics, Religion, Medicine, Art. The book uncovers the hidden motives by showing the discrepancy between the apparent intention and action. These discussions are also backed by evolutionary arguments and experiments on animals. I was really impressed by this aspect of the book. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an interesting book explaining one of the less explored aspects of human nature. Reading this might help to highten your self-perception. \\r\\n\\r\\n## The Trial by Franz Kafka\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being unfinished, Kafka\\'s novels have a great popularity. To understand the true legacy of Kafka, I picked up this book(this is my 3rd Kafka book. After Metamorphosis and Amerika). A sense of guilt still haunts me for not having understood Kafka\\'s celebrated genius in all of his books. The book has a good start, but over time, I felt chapters ended abruptly and many scenes were unnecessary. May be it requires more patience, skill and literary intelligence to appreciate Kafka and his work.  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Black Swan by N. N. Taleb\\r\\n\\r\\nA wonderful reading experience! The book deals with randomness and human perception of it. One can find many good discussions on broad range of topics(yet related to central theme of the book) like human bias, career advice, philosophy, baloney, Gaussian curve. The most important effect of this book is that it tries to make the reader aware of one\\'s own limitations(***anti-library,narrative fallacy,ludic fallacy,epistemic arrogance, Popper\\'s disproving, effect of the unseen, GIF, Locke\\'s madman, END(Evidence of No Disease) and NED(No Evidence of Disease), mediocristan vs extremistan*** ) and teaches to accept the key role of uncertainty(***Black swans***) and if possible try to take advantage of it(***barbell strategy, Appelles the painter,stochastic tinkering, practitioner, empiricist***). \\r\\n\\r\\nMany words marked in bold are the things that will hit you hard when you read the book.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important take away for me from the book is with discipline and meticulous planning, how one can improve one\\'s character(chapter - Plan for attaining Moral Perfection). I picked up this book when I came across Franklin\\'s efforts to improve his elegance in writing, mentioned in the book Peak(one of the most important Psychology books in my opinion).  At places, some witty insights like these are enjoyable\\r\\n\\r\\n> A  man being sometimes more generous when he has but little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro\\' fear of being  thought to have little.\\r\\n\\r\\n>  So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do\\r\\n\\r\\n> a benevolent man should allow a few defaults in himself to keep his friends in countenance\\r\\n\\r\\n> Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happened, as by little advantages that occur every day\\r\\n\\r\\nFor someone super organized like Franklin, no doubt that having small things in order leaves a room for lot of time and cognitive space to do more important things. But I confess that at times, I skimmed over parts where too many details of anecdotes were mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n##  The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book\\'s main aim is to explain evolution of life from Gene\\'s perspective.  Personally, the most impactful parts of the book were where Dawkins explains how several aspects of animal behaviour like preference for relatives over others, males\\' efforts to attract females arise from  genes acting in their selfish interest. On reflection, this makes us feel how strongly evolutionary wiring influences our daily actions and decisions. \\r\\n\\r\\nYet, the book also points out that only we humans are capable of acting against our evolutionary hard wiring. Evolution by giving rise to consciousness in humans made a machine(human), which could understand how it was built. Humans using a contraceptive is an example of an action against the gene\\'s dictatorship. \\r\\n\\r\\n> We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chapter on Memes(Mimeme, unit of cultural transmission) explains evolution of life from a cultural perspective. A thought-provoking explanation for questions like why traditions exist?,  how are they passed on from generation to generation?, why some traditions last so long? Somehow the book has left me with the impression that with proper usage of Gene\\'s and/or Meme\\'s point of view, one could explain the reason behind every single human action.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt several places in the book, well-written lines force the reader to pause and ponder its implications in one\\'s own life. When you pick up the book, give the longest pause when you see the below lines.  \\r\\n\\r\\n> .... When we die there  are two things we can leave behind us: genes and memes. We were built as gene machines, created to  pass on our genes. But that aspect of us will be forgotten in three generations. Your child, even your  grandchild, may bear a resemblance to you, perhaps in facial features, in a talent for music, in the colour of her hair. But as each generation passes, the contribution of your genes is halved. It does not take long  to reach negligible proportions. Our genes may be immortal but the collection of genes that is any one of  us is bound to crumble away. Elizabeth II is a direct descendant of William the Conqueror. Yet it is quite  probable that she bears not a single one of the old king\\'s genes. \\r\\n>\\r\\n> **We should not seek immortality in  reproduction**.  But if you contribute to the world\\'s culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking  plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool.  **Socrates may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today, as G. C. Williams has remarked,  but who cares? The meme-complexes of Socrates, Leonardo, Copernicus and Marconi are still going  strong**.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Life Lessons From Freud by Brett Kahr\\r\\n\\r\\nPicked this book because \"Freud\" was in the title.  Essays where some of the interesting Freud\\'s ideas are discussed - relation of filial piety and complacency, Freudian Slips, Freud\\'s respect for patients\\' privacy, affect of past on the unconscious mind, Freud\\'s theories on jokes and narcissism.  A good book to get introduced to some of Freud\\'s ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Slaughterhouse 5: The Children\\'s Crusade by Kurt Vonnegut\\r\\n\\r\\nThings that I loved about this book  - interesting non-linear story narration, neat writing style with lack of pomp and most importantly philosophical lessons about freewill by Tralfamadorians(an alien species).  A classic book that every literature enthusiast ought to read. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Amerika by Franz Kafka\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a Kafka\\'s unfinished novel. I picked up this book with a hope that I might recognize Kafka\\'s genius elements at least in this book. To my disappointment, I could not.  I admit that I dragged myself hard to finish this novel. But it was a good read. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka\\r\\n\\r\\nKafka though never achieved fame during his lifetime continued to write(the works that made Kafka popular are published after his death).  This, I felt is a true sign of love for writing. Hence I started picking up Kafka\\'s books.  Metamorphosis is a short and good read with a simple writing style.  I confess that I couldn\\'t grasp the genius elements of the book.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley\\r\\n\\r\\nHuxley is a writer with a deadly combination of Scientific knowledge and literary talents. After reading the essay, the reader is forced to think about the question - *do my everyday perception of the outer world reflect reality?*. Our brain filters a lot of sensory inputs as a lot of it is unnecessary for survival purpose. What would happen if you could somehow inhibit the filter in the brain and look at things as they are -**Ding an Sich**. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Essays by Orwell\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving read 1984 and Animal Farm, it is difficult to not to be mesmerized by Orwell\\'s simple yet powerful style of writing. The lack of pretense and urge to convey an idea is evident in his essays. Here are the list of the essays that you will enjoy\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  Why I write\\r\\n2. Good Bad Books\\r\\n3. English and Political Language\\r\\n4. Shooting an Elephant\\r\\n5. Such, such were the joys\\r\\n6. Bookshop Memories\\r\\n7. Confessions of a Book Reviewer\\r\\n8. Books vs Cigarettes\\r\\n\\r\\n## Animal Farm by George Orwell\\r\\n\\r\\nThe true genius of Orwell lies in the fact that this book can be read by anyone regardless of age and background and still get the core message - revolution that caused shifting of power from oppressor to oppressed might not necessarily improve conditions; power can corrupt the ideals. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Why don\\'t Students like School by Daniel T. Willingham\\r\\n\\r\\nAn excellent book about cognition of learning. Every teacher should be given a physical copy of the book and asked to read it atleast twice. The book not only explains learning from psychological perspective but also provides practical advice in bringing psychological findings into practice.\\r\\n\\r\\n## For some of the readings before 2022, you can check this [blog](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-02-27-2020-books/)\\r\\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-07-02-cryptovolatile.md': \"---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Volatility in Crypto vs Transaction Fee in FIAT\\nsubtitle: Don't discuss behind the authenticated walls\\ndate: 2021-07-02\\ncategories: [random, crypto]\\n---\\n\\nWhen you want to make a transaction overseas in a conventional way using FIAT currency, a charge of 10% of the amount sent goes to third party services which you are using. The problem here is that beneficiary receives only 90% of the amount you send. If the amount is of moderate size, the 10% loss seems significant. To avoid this, one can transfer the amount via Cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies are borderless. No matter to whom you transform, there is a small miner's fee, which is kind of negligible if the amount size is moderate. So, I preferred to do an overseas transaction via Litecoin, an altcoin where miner's fee is less. But I missed one point - Volatility of Crypto.\\n\\nCrypto is highly volatile. Though I was aware of it, I didn't consider it much as a serious issue till recently. I made the Litecoin transaction. And within 30 minutes, the value of coin fell by 5%. And in crypto space, this is a very common thing. You shouldn't be surprised if its value have fallen down more. But this is ridiculous, because it depends on when the beneficiary chooses to convert his Litecoins to FIAT. Suppose due to some misfortune, if the person decides to convert his/her coins urgently and he/she finds that value of Litecoin is down by large percent. It is a huge loss right! The beneficiary receives only a fraction of the amount that I had sent him/her. But there are 2 sides to a coin, the beneficiary can withdraw the coins when the value of Litecoin is high! This is really amazing. The beneficiary has received more than what I could give. \\n\\nBut the problem here is, uncertainty. You don't know when a coin rises or falls, you don't know how large the fluctuation will be, you don't know when the beneficiary wants to convert his/her coins to FIAT. To avoid this uncertainty, better make a FIAT transaction via a third party service, the 10% of the amount goes to third party service. But the good part is you can be sure that the beneficiary will receive nearly 90% of the amount that you had sent. Yes, there are fluctuations, but they are not as bad as crypto.\\n\\n## Better Option\\n\\nThere is an other way around. One can transfer via crypto only using coins whose value are backed to a stable coin. For example, the BUSD coin is backed to a US Dollar. There is no processing fee that goes to third party service except the negligible miner's fee. The volatility is almost absent.\\n\\n## About Me\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Decentralisation. I personally have read a lot about Bitcoin and its technicalities(I even wrote [a blog](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2019-12-25-mining-and-proof-of-work-in-bitcoin/) explaining Proof of Work). I also have a basic understanding of the economic principles of currencies. But there are some facts that upset me about Bitcoin/Cyrptocurrencies like \\n\\n- **Carbon Footprint**: The damage Proof of Work is doing to the environment. Theoretically, Proof of work protochol is an ingenious idea. But mining Bitcoin consumes electricity compared to the electricity used by an entire Nation [like Netherlands](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/bitcoin-btc-surge-renews-worries-about-its-massive-carbon-footprint.html). \\n\\n- **Centralized organizations built around Cryptocurrencies:** Their popularity makes feel that it defeats the purpose of a decentralized currency. If people are handing over their wallets, primary keys to a single organization, how is it different from a FIAT bank? Have we not learned from the [Mt. Gox disaster](https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/)\\n\\n- **Market manipulation and Volatility:** I have ranted enough about Volatility. There is enough [evidence](https://super-crypto1.medium.com/4th-dimension-bitcoin-manipulation-cartel-can-it-be-burnt-no-way-c53de65c166a) that Cartels manipulate Cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n  Cryptocurrencies are amazing because they have no entry barrier. Anyone with a smart phone can exchange value with cryptocurrencies. Startups that involve money transactions can grow rapidly as they don't have to deal with Government authorities([Jack Dorsey about the same in Lex's Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kPU9aLV57k)). But there are still some issues that need to be addressed in a p2p currency. I was really impressed with Facebook Libra(now [Diem](https://www.diem.com/en-us/)). Both the economic design and technical design seemed promising. But since it was Facebook, who was trying to do it, US Government didn't let allow them to continue the project. Sadly, they also lost some companies that were supporting them.\\n\\n  I always am excited about the question - what will be the future of money? When I heard about El Salvador adopting Bitcoin, I felt that more interesting events in future will unfold the answer. Let's see!\\n\",\n",
       " '_posts/2021-08-08-rules-for-writing.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Why bother to learn the rules for \"good\" writing\\nsubtitle: \\ndate: 2021-08-08\\ncategories: [writing]\\n---\\n\\nI recently showed my friend  [hemingwayapp.com](https://hemingwayapp.com/). It\\'s a tool that helps you detect the readability of the text. For example, it identifies sentences that are long and hard to read, find unnecessary words. I exclaimed that it is a nice tool that I wish to use more for my future writings. But my friend revolted telling *\"I think one should write in whatever way they want to without fretting too much over readability and shit. That just ruins the expression. If one expresses better using complex sentences then what\\'s the matter? Simplifying it would take away half the beauty of it\"*\\n\\nEven I had the same views previously as my friend. But after having come across some amazing writers and their works, I changed my views about writing. I started looking out ways to express myself better via writing. Here is a polished version of my reply.\\n\\n## Convey the meaning\\n\\nWriting is not just putting your thoughts on paper. It is a way of expressing your thoughts to the world. A good written piece has to convey the ideas of the writer to a reader fully. Writing that doesn\\'t do that is equivalent of expressing love to your lover in a language she/he doesn\\'t understand. For a reader to absorb what you have written, the content needs to be organised. Thinking is a fast process. You can get a complex idea within fraction of a second. But if you hasten to put  the thoughts onto a paper immediately, it will be disorganised. A reader will not be able to understand your thoughts. \\n\\nIn the book Godel, Escher, Bach, Hofstadter discusses a thought experiment. Suppose a [LP record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record) of Bach\\'s Sonata in F minor is sent to outer space on a rocket. Suppose an alien civilisation happens to find that record. What would be the true deciphering of the record? The grooves on the disk may intrigue the aliens and let us say the are intelligent enough to figure out how to produce sounds from the disk. But mere production of sounds is not worthwhile. As Hofstadter puts it, true deciphering of the record is said to be done *when their brain structures create emotional effects in them analogous to the emotional effects we experience in hearing the music*. I like to think of writing as the same way.  When people feel a emotion strongly, they want to share it. A writer is no exception, she chooses to share her emotion via her writing. The function of a good written piece is to create the same emotion in reader, which writer has felt.\\n\\n## Writing is Bidirectional\\n\\n![Escher-Drawing hands](https://en.opisanie-kartin.com/images/2/image2261.jpg)\\n\\nAlso, many consider writing to be a unidirectional process - ideas are transferred from one\\'s mind onto a paper. But its bidirectional. Writing also gives a feedback on your thinking. As you write, the words begin to modify your thoughts. Your thoughts in turn modify your words. It\\'s a loop. I have personally felt that when I write, I start realising about few things that I haven\\'t figured out. It forces me to think about a particular idea in a particular direction. It\\'s a valuable feedback!\\n\\nThis is reminiscent of Feynman technique. To test whether you have understood something, you try explaining it on a paper as if you were explaining it to a kid. In this process, if you find yourself using jargon words to explain any concept then it is a sign that your understanding of that concept is hollow. Go back and revise the concept, and try again till you have eliminated jargon from your explanation. The same is the case with writing!\\n\\nOne of my favourite quotes - **A writer is a person for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people**. I used to have a misconception that writers have this amazing gift to express themselves flawlessly. But on digging deep, I realised how much effort goes into writing about something clearly. After learning these facts, I have started to appreciate and analyse my favourite works more.\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n- I have compiled a list of useful resources on good writing here in my evernote - [Improve Writing](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s367/sh/1e4ede00-5187-55d8-ae04-7f99f23ffabe/92985a220e9a6ffa3d68dfb0a81ca15e) \\n\\n- The Hofstadter\\'s thought experiment is taken from Chapter VI - The Location of Meaning of Godel, Escher, Bach. An [interesting talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSfe5M_zG2s) that might inspire you to read the book.\\n\\n- In Escher\\'s Drawing Hands, the left hand draws the right hand and right hand in turn draws the left hand. This is a Strange Loop! My views on writing are similar - While writing, words modifies your thoughts and your thoughts in turn modify your writing.\\n\\n- Image source of Escher\\'s Drawing Hands - https://en.opisanie-kartin.com/images/2/image2261.jpg\\n\\n  \\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-02-26-stepping-out-of-system.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle:  Stepping outside the System\\nsubtitle: My favourite idea of GEB\\ndate: 2021-02-26\\ncategories: [books, GEB]\\n---\\n\\nIn the book GEB, there is puzzle called MU puzzle, which goes this way...\\n\\n![MU Puzzle from Wikipedia](https://i.imgur.com/paaaPwj.png) \\n\\nAfter trying rigorously for half an hour, I stopped and suspected if it is possible to solve this. After some googling, I found that my suspicion was right, it is not possible to obtain the string MU from MI, with the given rules of production. The reason is hard to find. But below is a simple explanation. \\n\\nOne way to think of it is, you have \"x\" number of I s(read as eyes). And at the end you want x to be equal to zero. The second and third rules change the number of I s. As per the second rule number of I s becomes 2x, while the third rule changes it to x-3. The desired outcome x being zero, implies that x has to be divisible by 3(because zero is divisible by 3). Initially, if x is not divisible by 3, then\\n\\n1. 2x will also not be divisible by 3. Doubling the number will not make it divisible by 3, if it isn\\'t already divisible by 3\\n2. x - 3 will also not be divisible by 3. Remove 3 from the number will not make it divisible by 3, if it isn\\'t already divisible by 3\\n\\nAs per the puzzle, we start with x = 1, which is not divisible by 3; that implies we cannot ever reach a state where x is divisible by 3; hence you cannot ever get x = 0, which is desired. To conclude, we cannot achieve the state MU by any combination of the rules provided.\\n\\nThis is not an easy thing for a person to come up. But here is another simple example. If given `MI`, can you produce the string `I`, using the given rules. No! Because there is no rule, which reduces the count of M s.\\n\\nBut when you feed the same problem to a machine - feeding the rules and and axiomatic string MI, it will never stop, it will continue to form new strings and check if they are MU or not.\\n\\n![Taken from GEB Pg. 40](https://imgur.com/SzXUzZg.png)\\n\\nThe machine does not stop on its own, because it cannot think outside of the rules. We as a human, when rules of a system are given, are capable of stepping out of the system and reflect on the rules. Doug argues that would be the main characteristic of a truly intelligent machine, being able to step out of the rules, reflect on them and be capable of modifying the instructions based on the outcome.\\n\\n```\\nIt is inherent property of intelligence that it can jump out of the task which it is performing and survey what it has done; it is always looking for and often finding, patterns.\\n\\nPg.37 GEB\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Philosophical Implications\\n\\nWhat excites me more is this philosophical implication of the idea. There is a line in GEB..\\n\\n```\\nOf course, there are cases where only a rare individual will have the vision to perceive\\na system which governs many people’ lives, a system which had never before even been\\nrecognized as a system; then such people often devote their lives to convincing other\\npeople that the system really is there, and that it ought to be exited from!\\n \\nPg.37 GEB\\n```\\n\\nAnd I found its explanation in the [MIT OCW notes]([Chapter 5: The MU–Puzzle (mit.edu)](https://ocw.mit.edu/high-school/humanities-and-social-sciences/godel-escher-bach/lecture-notes/MITHFH_geb_v3_5.pdf))\\n\\n![People who have stepped outside the system](https://imgur.com/6kD9T4L.png)\\n\\n### My interpretation \\n\\nIt means one as an individual not just has to follow rules given to him/her(in a community or society or workplace), he/she must also \"step outside the system\" and reflect upon the rules - question the rules - \"is it really true?\", \"what are its outcomes?\", \"why does one have to do this way?\". This I believe helps an individual to question conformist behavior  and help him/her become an independent thinker. Being able to think on own is a rare quality!\\n\\n\\n\\n## Footnotes\\n\\n- While many condemn Karl Marx due to what it has caused in USSR and China. A proper look into the history will reveal that Karl Marx was largely misinterpreted by the cruel leaders. A good explanation regarding it can be found in watch Episode 1 of [Genius of the Modern World - Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80186252).

       " '_posts/2020-07-12-automate-deploy.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle:  Automate deployment on an EC2 instance using Github Webhooks\\nsubtitle: Example of CD for a Django Project\\ndate: 2020-07-12\\ncategories: [programming]\\n---\\n\\n# Credits\\nThis article have been mainly inspired by the project -[Midgard](https://github.com/iit-technology-ambit/Midgard). Thanks to [Pankaj Kumar](https://github.com/Shankusu993) with whom I setup this Continuous deployment. I am a newbie in this field of deployment. If any mistakes, please do provide a feedback. Also thanks to [Shubham Mishra](https://github.com/grapheo12) for helping us in the process.\\n\\n# Problem Statement\\nThere is a repository on github and you have an EC2 instance(or any instance provided by an IaaS). On every push to certain branch, you want the code in the instance to be updated.\\n\\n# Approach\\nFor every repo, Github provides something called Webhooks. On occurance of an event(pull request or push or issue or comment, there is a long list you can find in settings)Â\\xa0 every time Github sends a POST request with payload to the server, whose link you provide in the Repo settings.\\nWe build a Flask server and deploy it on the EC2 instance. And provide its link in the github webhooks section. So on every push when a payload is sent to the Flask Server, it runs a Bash Script which pulls from the Github the updated code and restarts the necessary things(like systemd service).\\n\\n# Action:\\n### Script:-\\nFor this example, I am considering deployment of a Django project([ref](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04)).  Suppose the name of the project is `myproject`, and is present at the location `/home/username/myproject` in the instance. Assuming the systemd service file is written in a file name   `myproject.service`. Lets make Bash Script file - `deploy.sh`\\n```\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\ncd /home/username/myproject \\n\\n/usr/bin/git fetch\\nsleep 5\\n\\n/usr/bin/git reset --hard origin/master\\nsleep 5\\n\\nsource env/bin/activate\\nsleep 5\\n\\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\\nsleep 5\\n\\npython3 manage.py migrate\\nsleep 5\\n\\nsudo systemctl restart myproject.service\\n\\n```\\nFrom the above  code, it is clear that these following steps are done in order\\n- Moving to project directory\\n- \"Force pulling\" from repo\\'s master branch. - Using fetch and reset --hard\\n-  Activating the virtual environment\\n- Installing requirements \\n- Migrating DB\\n- Restarting the service\\n\\nI would like to emphasize few things here \\n- Usage of /usr/bin/git instead of  just git . Using just `git` doesn\\'t help\\n- Instead of doing `git pull`, we are doing `fetch` and `reset  --hard`. Reason sometimes we force push to certain branches after squashing commits or rebasing in that case using just git pull won\\'t update\\n- The command sudo systemctl restart myproject.service is executed without password? This could be done because we added a line in /etc/sudoers ([ref1](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/192706/how-could-we-allow-non-root-users-to-control-a-systemd-service)), ([ref2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-edit-the-sudoers-file))\\n  ```\\n  %username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart myproject.service\\n\\t```\\n- I have added sleep in middle so that execution of commands continuously doesn\\'t overload the instance CPU usage.\\n\\n### Flask Application:-\\nRefer [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uswgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04) to deploy a Flask application. And the code in `\"app.py\"` (the file which is run to start the server) like this.\\n```\\nfrom flask import Flask, request\\nfrom subprocess import call\\nimport os\\nimport json\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n@app.route(\"/\", methods=[\\'GET\\', \\'POST\\']) \\ndef deploy():\\n    if json.loads(request.get_data().decode(\"utf-8\"))[\"ref\"] == \\'refs/heads/master\\':\\n        call([\"./deploy.sh\"], shell=True) \\n        return \"Success\", 200\\n    return \"Success - not updated\", 200\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    app.run(host=\\'0.0.0.0\\')\\n```\\n\\nWhen the Github Webhook is going to hit a POST request with payload at `/`  route\\nwe are going to check from the payload that push is made to master branch or not. If so, then we run the script that we made above and return a string with status 200. If not then we simply return another string with  status 200.\\nLets say this flask application deployed with domain name - `deploy.example.com`\\n\\n### Configuring Github Webhooks:-\\nGo to Settings  of your repository. On the vertical Navbar present at the left click on the Webhooks\\nClick on Add webhooks. And select the options as per the below image. Regarding the secret, better keep a randomly generated long string.\\n![Github Webhook Settings](/img/github_webhooks.png.PNG)\\n\\nSo, now as we planned on every push Github will send a payload to the Flask server, which contains a lot of details. On receiving the details, the Flask server will  check if the push has be done to the particular branch or not(here \\'master\\'). If yes, it \"pulls\" the code from github and executes the necessary commands put in the Bash Script.\\n\\n# Still Facing Issues?\\n- Sometimes it takes time for changes to be reflected especially in the case of DNS changes. So if things don\\'t work out immediately check if this is the issue.\\n- In case you made changes to the Flask Server, don\\'t forget to restart the service.\\n- Script didn\\'t run?

       " '_posts/2021-02-24-dh-dense.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle:  Why Douglas Hofstadter writings are dense\\nsubtitle: Explaining one of my favourite ideas from GEB\\ndate: 2021-02-24\\ncategories: [books, GEB]\\n---\\n\\n# Why DH writings are dense\\n\\nI have seen in many videos and reviews people complain that GEB and other Douglas Hofstadter(DH)\\'s books are very dense, he takes infinite time to explain something. In this blog, I wish to explain a sophisticated argument on why DH\\'s writings are dense, and why I feel they should be. Of course, a simple explanation can be made that he tries explaining the example in great detail so that less informed people also understand. Another explanation can be that the more time the reader spends with the idea, it is stored in reader\\'s long term memory. But here, I wish to use one of the ideas from the GEB and explain the same.  For me this is one of the most beautiful ideas present in GEB and it really gives a good framework when you want to deal with \"complicated\" things or you planning to explain a complicated thing to someone. Here by \"complicated\" I mean something very specific. I called something, say X complicated if explanation of X involves different steps and each step further might involve complicated things.\\n\\n## Notion of Symbols\\n\\nSuppose, there is an idea or concept, which can be further broken down into modules, which are smaller ideas or concepts, then we can call such each module as symbols. For example, if you consider the question why things fall, the answer would be gravity. But what is gravity? Gravity is a force due to large mass of Earth, which pulls object downwards. What is Force? - Force is the cause for changing the states of body between rest and motion. What is Earth? -  Earth is a planet on which we humans live. [0]\\n\\n\\n\\n![Symbol model of Gravity](https://i.imgur.com/vrXf5P7.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother example, say you are learning Taekwondo(or any other martial art). The first time you are taught front kick is this way - Stand in a position with one foot facing forward, position your arms, lift your back knee, point your knee towards your target, strike your target, put your foot back. To a beginner in martial the symbols would be something like this in his/her mind. \\n\\n\\n\\n![Symbol Model of Front Kick](https://i.imgur.com/VkOs9V6.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nTo summarize, any thought or concept in human mind exists as symbol which is linked with other symbols\\n\\n## But do you think like that? \\n\\nBut when you don\\'t want to hold a object, do you consciously think of the fact that you are leaving on a planet, and due to the the large mass of the planet, it has tendency to pull objects down, hence if I leave the object in air, it will not float, rather it might fall, hence I have to place it on a surface, which can hold it. No, right! You just have it in mind, as single concept - gravity. In fact, this same gravity is further used to explain more complex phenomenon like Planets revolving around the sun.\\n\\n Once you have practiced enough Taekwondo, you won\\'t think of each step consciously while striking your opponent with a front kick. Once you have practiced the front kick several times, the movements will be performed sub-consciously. Now using this front kick, you can learn more complicated kicks  - Side kick, Jumping front kick and further the jumping side kick.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you spend enough time with a anything , it becomes a single symbol. You don\\'t have to think of the other sub-concepts  every time. \\n\\nThat is the same reason why DH spends a lot of time, with single concept - explaining the concept using simplest words in different ways, trying to give analogies, giving exercises to the reader so that the idea or concept is stuck as a single symbol in his brain. For example, consider Gödel\\'s theorem, there is a significant amount of time involved in explaining expressing number theory statements as TNT, in fact there are exercises given at the end of it too for the reader to practice. This translation is a important aspect of Godel\\'s theorem proof. Now, while explaining the proof, DH doesn\\'t have to explain translation steps there in detail, as a proper reader would have firm grasp of the concept. That is why DH could explain Gödel\\'s theorem in just 12 pages - 348 to 350.\\n\\nAdded to this advantage, since each concept in Gödel\\'s theorem proof is present as a symbol in reader\\'s mind. He could explain isomorphic concepts at other places too(like the typogenetics) in a simpler way and the reader could grasp with very little effort, despite having no background in biology or Mathematics.[1]\\n\\n## Implications\\n\\nSuppose you want to explain a concept - \"A\". Explanation of A first involves Step 1, which requires explaining another concept\"A1\", similarly for Step 2 requires \"A2\", and for the final step - Step 3 requires \"A3\".\\n\\nAn approach would be to explain A1 strongly. By strongly explain, it means to spend enough time with the idea of A1[2] ,make sure that it is a single symbol in brain. Give it some catchy name so that it stays in audience head. Repeat the process with A2 and A3.\\n\\nYou can see that with this approach explaining A becomes so easy, because your thought process would be something like this\\n\\n- To do A, we need to do Step 1, and Step 1 is achieved with A1\\n- To procced to Step 2, we use A2\\n- And for the final step, we use A3\\n\\nThe advantage of the above process is that One will always have a big picture of A in mind, as A1 and A2 and A3 are just symbols which together help build A\\n\\nAs opposed to the above method,  more conventional way would be to start your discussion with step 1, explain A1. Once you are done with A1, you start discussing step 2 explain A2 , and similarly with A3. But wait? Aren\\'t these 2 similar? The crucial thing, which is missing in the second method would be to establish A1, A2 and A3 are single independent symbols rather than learning A1, A2 and A3 as a side product of A. The added advantage of the former method is that, A1,A2 and A3 are reusable at other places, as now they are independent symbols. We can use them in a different complex scenarios. For example, if some other problem involves A2, it would be easy to solve it as the person has A2 as an independent symbol in his/her mind. But if someone had learnt \"A\" through the second method, he/she would have to recall that a similar things was done while learning \"A\", and then go through each step of A, and relate things.\\n\\nOne crucial thing which I feel is missing in the first method is while explaining A1, A2 and A3 one has to provide the learner a motivation to why they are learning A1, A2 and A3. In second method it is apparent, as A1, A2 and A3 occur in a logical sequence. It is here that the presenter\\'s skills come into play, the presenter might chose to teach it as an exciting idea or before hand reveal the spoiler that Step 2 will be used in A. A good presenter has to have a combination of both.\\n\\n## Footnotes\\n\\n[0] - It is all wrong. Gravity is geometry not a force as per General Relativity, which reveals the true nature of Universe. However Newtonian analogy still holds well for most of the cases.\\n\\n[1] - Here I tried to embed the idea of symbols as a single symbol using at least 2 examples - gravity and Front kick in Taekwondo.\\n\\n[2] - If you presenting A1 in a lecture, then ideally it is better if it is explained within a time period of a [microcentury]([microcentury - Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury)). \\n\\n[3] - If you have read the book [Peak, by Anders Ericsson]([Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak:_Secrets_from_the_New_Science_of_Expertise)), he mentions that the main difference between experts and beginners is due to mental representations. And one can develop their mental representations by inculcating deliberate practice. I feel that these 2 ideas are closely related, with enough deliberate practice, complicated ideas act as a single symbol in an expert\\'s mind.\\n',\n",

But it also applies to other cryptocurrencies following the same consensus protocol(we will see what that exactly means). My aim, while writing this is to provide some intuition behind proof of work algorithm and to explain in detail behind the puzzle that is solved by the miners in order to add a valid block to the Blockchain. I will be focussing on the parts which are not very abundant on the internet or are compromised with a high-level overview of things.\\n# Intuition behind consensus protocols and Proof of work\\nBitcoin or in fact any other cryptocurrency is decentralized. That means there is **NO** central authority to provide services, maintain records, etc. That is the main aim of introducing Bitcoin - Having no central Master. In our daily life, it is the banks that send money on our behalf, keep a track of how much money each individual is left with. Now in case of a decentralized system, how do you achieve that? \\nThe set of rules by which a decentralized system comes to an agreement that \\'Yes! this is the state of the system.\\'.  For example in  Bitcoin, everyone needs to come to the conclusion that a particular transaction is valid and can be appended to the Blockchain. \\nNow for Bitcoin, let\\'s think of a naive Consensus protocol, where each member in the network provides one vote. Seems fair? No!\\nWell in Bitcoin, to become a part of a network all you need is a device and internet connection. A malicious individual(say Mr.X) can easily take advantage of this. X can now create multiple identities with ease. He will create a fake transaction and broadcast it to the network. Since many of the nodes in the network are controlled by X, they will receive the majority votes and hence will be validated. Likewise, there might be many people like X in the network. The whole system is flawed :(\\nSo what can be done?  The basic step towards solving this problem is to make the process of voting a bit difficult. Or to rephrase it- Make a vote costlier. That means, for an individual in the network to vote whether the transaction is valid or not he or she also has to spend some resources.  Resources that are valuable, available with everyone so that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. Satoshi Nakamoto(inventor of Bitcoin) chose \"Computing Power\". In order to validate a transaction, you need to spend some amount of computing power. You need to provide proof that you have spent your resources to validate the transactions and add them to the blockchain. This proof is provided by solving a cryptographic hash puzzle(we will see in detail about it) which is computationally difficult to solve since the only way to get the right answer is by trial and error.  This consensus Protocol is named as *Proof of Work*.\\nIn simpler words, Proof of work is a method by which you translate your computing power to voting power. That is also why, in bitcoin white paper you can see the words `1 CPU 1 Vote`, rather than `1 Identity 1 Vote`, which is a general case.\\nWhat is the Cryptographic Hash puzzle? How is it solved? To understand that, we need to know about the anatomy of a Block in Bitcoin Blockchain.\\n\\n# Anatomy of a block\\nA block in a blockchain consists of these following things(* means will explain soon)\\n*  Block header: Consists of Metadata of the block, which enforces the security of the blockchain\\n    * Previous block hash: Evident from the name,  Hash of the Previous Block\\n    * Merkle Root*\\n    * Nonce *\\n    * Timestamp: Evident from the name, time at which the block was created.\\n    * Version:  Version of the Bitcoin software used by the miner\\n    * Block hash*\\n    * Bits*\\n* Blocksize:  Size of the block\\n* Transaction Counter: Number of transactions in a block\\n* Transactions: The actual list of transactions\\n# Merkle Root:\\nIt is the hash of the transactions in a tree fashion. In simpler words, Merkle root is the summary hash of all the transactions of a given block. Check the below image for clarity.\\n![Merkle Root](https://imgur.com/60c1MUC.png)\\n\\nWhy do you have to do that? Why not just hash all of them Linearly at once?\\nThe main reason behind this is that it will be computationally cheaper to verify whether a single transaction is present or not in this case.  \\nSuppose there are 8 transactions, as per the below image and we hash all of them linearly to obtain the summary, to verify any transaction we need all the other 7 transactions, Check the image below\\n\\n![Non Merkle Root 7 are required](https://imgur.com/2ANo5a2.png)\\n\\nIn case of a tree, you need just three hashes that are marked in blue to verify whether that particular transaction exists or not\\n\\n![Merkle only 3 are required](https://imgur.com/hNwsePW.png)\\n\\nBlockHash:\\nBlock hash is obtained by hashing these three things - Previous Blockhash, Merkle root, and Nonce. \\nNonce:\\nA nonce is a number that is hashed with Previous block hash and Merkle root to find a valid block hash. When do you consider a block hash valid? A block hash is considered valid when it is less than a specific number called `target` which is embedded in Bits of the block.\\nBits:\\nAs mentioned previously, it is a compact notation of the target. For example, taken from [this](http://blog.geveo.com/Blockchain-Mining-Difficulty) article\\nBits of a certain block is 402809567 in decimal when converted to hex: 18 02 62 DF. \\nNow the first byte indicates the length of the hash target. So in this case,  24 (18 in hex) would be the length of the hash target. And the next 3 bytes are the most significant digits of the hash target. Hence the hash target would be \\nas per this image\\n# The cryptographic Hash puzzle\\nNow let us understand the puzzle that is solved to add a block to the blockchain. It is here that you get a clear understanding of the terms - Nonce, and Bits. \\nA miner\\'s job is to find a number that when hashed with the Previous Block hash and Merkle root gives the hash which is less than the hash target of the block.\\nIn simpler words \\nhash(prevBlockhash, MerkleRoot, Num) < HashTarget\\nOur aim is to find the Num \\nThe starting value of Num is 0, they hash it and check if the hash is less than HashTarget or not. If not increment it and hash it again and check again if it is less than the hash target or not. And the process is continued until a valid block hash is found, that means finally the resulting hash is less than the HashTarget.\\nThe Num is called Nonce because it is used only once to check, if it doesn\\'t meet our requirements, then we increment and continue checking. But we are not going to use the same number again with a particular pair of Previous Blockhash and Merkle Root.\\nBy solving the cryptographic hash puzzle to validate transactions means to find a number when hashed with previous block hash and the summary hash of transactions(Merkle root) results in a number less than the hash target. This is what it all boils down to!\\nHow tough is this?\\nJust for sake of analogy, imagine if you are blindfolded and you are asked to hit only a specific region of the dartboard. How can you achieve it? The only way is by throwing more darts on the board hoping that they would hit the specific region. Similarly here, the only way is to increase the probability of success is by checking with more numbers(Nonces). \\nNow you can see that it takes a decently large amount of computing power to add a block to the blockchain, hence validate the list of transactions. Hence, the miner who has solved the puzzle has a \\'proof of work\\' done by finding the valid block hash, which we have seen how computationally expensive is this.\\n### What is the maximum value of the nonce? Does it keeping going on and on and on.....?\\nNo! The nonce is a 32-byte value. So its maximum value is 2^32 - 1. What if no value of nonce satisfies the given condition. That is no number less than equal to 2^32-1 when hashed with the previous block hash and Merkle root of the block results in hash less than the hash target?\\nDo we change the hash target?\\nNo!\\nDo we change the previous block hash?\\nObviously No! How can one do that?\\nThe left thing is Merkle Root. How do you change that?\\nWe have missed one fact! Let us see that here:\\n\\n# Coinbase Nonce\\nWhen a miner adds a valid block to the blockchain, he receives a fixed reward. Even that is considered as one of the transactions in the block, that has a special name called \\'Coinbase Transaction\\'. At the lowest level in the Merkle tree, the coin base transaction is the first transaction. There is something called  \\'Coinbase Nonce\\', which is just arbitrary data that is hashed in the process of creating a Merkle root. Now to change the Merkle root, since we can\\'t change the rest of the transactions. It is this Coinbase Nonce that can be changed and hence changing the Merkle Root.\\nNow you can start the nonce value fresh from 0 again and check by hashing with the previous Blockhash and this new Merkle Root verify. Increment the nonce and repeat the process.  If that fails too, try again with a different Coinbase nonce, hence a different Merkle Root\\n# Reward for miners\\nThere is a reward for miners for every valid block they add to the blockchain. Generally, this reward is decreased by 1/2 for every 210,000 blocks. The initial block rewards from the beginning were 50 BTC.  The current Blockreward is 12.5 BTC. 210,000 blocks are approximately mined for a period of 4 years. (You will see soon how these are approximated). There is one more interesting thing to note. Mining is the only process through which Bitcoins can be generated. So, one can conclude that the maximum number of Bitcoins that can exist are:\\n\\n```210,000(50 + 25 + 12.5  + 6.25 + ....) = 21,000,000 BTC```\\n\\n21 Million is the maximum number of bitcoin that can be created. \\n# Is the Hash target fixed?\\nNo dear!  There are times where there are more miners in the network, and times when there are very few in the network. The main goal of Satoshi Nakamoto was to keep the block time fixed as approximately 10 minutes. That is for every 10 minutes, a block is added to the blockchain. \\nThe way to keep this time constant is to adjust the Hash target. Suppose there are many miners in the network, and the blocks are getting mined soon. We need to increase the difficulty of the puzzle - that implies we need to reduce the Hash target. Why?  Because there are fewer choices. For example, if the hash target was 0FFFF (65,535), which means the miner needs to find a nonce which when hashed with previous Block hash and Merkle Root gives a number less than 65,535. We have 65,536 choices(0 to 65,535). Too many! Now if the hash target was 000FF(255), we have only 256 choices. \\nAnd if there are less number of miners, it means the blocks are mined slowly, hence we need to make the puzzle easier, Hence increase the Hash target. In analogy with the Darts game, think of it as adjust the radius of the region where you want the dart to get hit.\\nAnd this is changed on observing the average block time of the last 2016 blocks(approximately every 2 weeks, why?\\n2016 x 10 mins = 20160 mins  = 14 days = 2 Weeks).\\nTo quantify the above words:\\n\\n![Hash Target](https://imgur.com/kkP3jMI.png)\\n\\n*Image Credits from [this blog](http://blog.geveo.com/Blockchain-Mining-Difficulty)*\\n\\n# Final words\\nCurrently, Most of the mining in bitcoin is not done individually. People who mine come together and form Mining pools. Here, under the guidance of a pool manager, profits are distributed accordingly as per various pool schemes. \\nThis is just one of the many interesting aspects of Bitcoin. Finally, I would like to conclude with this beautiful tweet!\\n![Tweet](https://imgur.com/Ci92KRS.png)',\n",

A club, in context of college, is a group of like-minded students interested in a particular skill or hobby. You can find clubs for programmers, dancers, western music, eastern music, journalism, robotics, anime enthusiasts. These groups play a key role in an individual\\'s social life and personal development during one\\'s college life. Spent enough time with the group, you not only hone your skills but also make some very close friends. \\n\\nBut I believe that every such group has a social responsibility of sharing at least the basics of their skill to the rest of the people. Learning something on own requires lot of time, effort, trial and error. With aid of someone who has spent time in the field, the process becomes faster and enjoyable. Though one may not be interested to do that for a long time, but they get a taste of what it is and can appreciate better. \\n\\nTo put it concretely, clubs should organise activities that help more people get started with something new or may be at least inspire enough to learn more. For example, \\n\\n- A programming club can conduct workshops that cover basics of different topics, organise hackathons, share useful resources regularly. \\n\\n- A literature club can organise book clubs, conduct seminars explaining famous authors and their works, organise essay writing competitions. \\n\\n- A dancers society can conduct workshops to help people get started with some basic moves that they can show off in a party. \\n\\n- A music society can conduct seminars explaining theory behind good music, workshops to teach the basics of piano(there are enough piano mobile applications!). \\n\\n\\nThese are some of the many things that people would like to learn or explore. Of course, you have the internet for everything. But there is a lot on the internet to overwhelm a beginner, and most of the time it is difficult for someone just getting started to sit alone and explore. Instead learning something new in a group from your fellow college mates is an exciting experience. Both the learner and the learnt would feel a great sense of inner satisfaction. A good side effect of these workshops is that it will give people opportunity to come out of their rooms and make new friends while trying something new.\\n\\nGoing out and trying something new is a better way to spend time than being involved in passive activities like watching shows. Learning something new has a potential to give us a change of perspective in life. I believe such activities by these clubs will help the community as a whole to grow and make people happier.\\n\\n>  What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured \\n>\\n>  Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\\n\\n## Post Scriptum\\n\\n- Some ideas for a literature society can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZzF2sFkdNTKQC6PsJ-NiLIX3RFrso7dO/view?usp=sharing)\\n\\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-08-05-slack-search.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Collapse of a Grand Plan\\nsubtitle: An attempt to liberate hidden useful discussions\\ndate: 2021-08-05\\ncategories: [programming]\\n---\\n\\nThe current blog explains the journey of an ambitious task from idea to failure. The ambitious task was to index the data behind authenticated walls. A lot of useful discussions goes on in Slack and Discord servers. Most of the discussions are potential answers to beginners queries. Yet, when queries are typed in any search engine like Google or Bing, the discussions won\\'t appear in the search results, as they are being authenticated walls. \\n\\nIf you are someone interested in the idea of [making useful discussions open](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-07-01-useful-discussions-open/), that is you don\\'t like the idea of discussions behind authenticated walls and are planning to work on this problem, you can skip to `Lessons Learned` section to know the important things that you need to keep in mind.\\n\\n## Noticing the problem\\n\\nWhen I was exploring Quantum Computing, I once had a simple specific query - \"How to measure m qubits out of n qubits\". I knew there was a small change needed to be made in `qc.measure()` function. But even after checking the documentation and googling for an hour, I still couldn\\'t find the answer. So, at the end I had asked in Qiskit Slack, and a kind man by name [Jack Woehr](https://github.com/jwoehr) answered it. \\n\\nBut then I thought - what if someone else in future had googled the same problem? Then she/he wouldn\\'t find the answer in search results, because the answer is behind an authenticated wall(Qiskit Slack Workspace in this case). So, to solve that I wrote [a blog](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-02-12-measure-m-outof-n/) on my website, answering the problem.\\n\\nThough I felt felt this was a serious problem, I didn\\'t give much thought to it as I was interested in other fields at that time! \\n\\n## Opportunity to work on the problem \\n\\nAfter several months, I joined [Neera.ai](http://neera.ai/) as an intern. If you see the tag line of Neera Search Engine on the `<head>` of the site, it says \"One search to rule them all\". Neera\\'s plan was to have a single search bar to search through the personal documents, along with websites that regular search engines provide. \\n\\nSo, in the initial weeks, I and [Sahil](https://sahil-shubham.in/) worked on providing search in Pocket, Notion and Google Drive Documents at Neera. At neera, new third party tools were used to solve common problems to avoid re-inventing the wheel. For example [Supertokens](https://supertokens.io/) was used for authentication and [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) was used for Database Hosting. Both these tools had their own discord servers. Developers use to post their queries in relevant public channels and would get the reply within minutes.\\n\\nI liked how fast people got response to their queries and how discord interface was convenient for exchanging information at a faster rate. But none of the discussions would appear as a search result on any search engine. This reminded me of the problem that I had noticed many months before. I felt that sooner all the queries related to such tools will be on discord. Slack workspaces and Discord servers were replacing Open forums like Reddit and Stackoverflow. So, when someone searches a query, she/he won\\'t find it in the search results. They have to join the server and re-ask the question. \\n\\nI felt that this was a serious problem, I also wrote a blog about it on my site - [Useful discussions should be open](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-07-01-useful-discussions-open/), where I had recommended that online communities should communicate on subreddits, as opposed to popular practice of using Discord Servers and Slack Workspaces. I argued in the blog that the useful discussions are too important to be behind Authenticated walls.\\n\\nSo, I proposed to [Harsh](https://hargup.substack.com/) and [Sahil](http://sahil-shubham.in/) that this was an important problem and something which we can solve. Both agreed to it, as we started working on Slack Integration first. Our plan was to enable Neera users to search through their Slack workspaces.\\n\\n## Implementation and Struggles\\n\\nFor Pocket and Notion Integration with Neera, the process was simple. The user would connect Neera to the Service(Pocket/Notion) via [OAuth2](https://sahil-shubham.in/posts/oauth/). We would get the access tokens. Neera would make the API requests to the service via the access token of the user. This worked great, so our plan was to repeat the same with Slack. We started with Slack because it provided a Search API to search through workspace messages. We didn\\'t have to index any workspace messages on our own. \\n\\nBut unfortunately, slack doesn\\'t provide the access to search endpoint, if user connects via OAuth2. The only other option available was to make a Slack App. Using OAuth2 the Slack app could be installed in the workspaces. Depending upon the workspace rules, any workspace member could install a App in the workspace or it would require permissions from Workspace owners.\\n\\nWe built the \"Neera Search\" Slack app with minimum scopes. The app could only read messages in Public channels, search messages in Public channels. No write access was given to the app. When the app is installed via OAuth2 in Useful workspaces, any Neera user will be able to search through the slack messages. We felt that it had liberated the knowledge in these workspaces by smashing the authentication walls.\\n\\nBut in one of the meetings, a question frightened us - what if some user adds her/his private slack workspace unknowingly. Not all workspaces have a public invitation link. There are some workspaces, which are intended for private discussions. We didn\\'t wanted such messages to be made publicly searchable. To prevent this, we decided that we would manually  install the app in the workspace by ourselves from a slack account, made by Neera. We will obviously be able to join Workspaces, whose invitation links are public. Hence, the risk of adding some private workspace messages being searchable is now zero. \\n\\nAt the time of releasing the feature of Slack search, we added 2 open Slack workspaces - [Metakgp](https://metakgp.github.io/) workspace and [Kharagpur Winter of Code](http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/) Workspace. Our next aim was to include popular workspaces that are popular among developer communities. Some of my friends suggested CNCF Slack and Gopher Slack. These workspaces are too large. The number of people in both the workspaces individually is more than 40 thousand. In both the workspaces, there were many technical discussions going on. We were very excited at the idea that all these discussions could be made available easily just with one search in Neera.\\n\\nSince the workspaces were large, there was a restriction on who could install the App. So, we posted a message in a public channel in both the workspaces explaining that installing the \"Neera Search\" Slack app in their workspace would make these discussions at any developer\\'s finger tips via Neera. It will also spread awareness about the workspace, which will lead to more people joining the discussions happening in workspace.\\n\\nBut things started going an unexpected way!\\n\\n## \"This is all Private data!\"\\n\\nWe got a strong \"NO\" from many of the members in both the workspaces. There were 2 common objections. First was that there was a policy that they don\\'t install apps that they haven\\'t coded themselves. With enough discussions, one could convince the admins to break this rule once for greater good, but the second objection was a strong one. The second objection was that *all these messages in the Slack are private, you can\\'t index them.* We tried to convince the usefulness of our app, but their concern was that how could you index all these messages, it violates privacy. What could we say to that?\\n\\nI was dumbfounded when I heard from people that it was Private data. The invitation link of the Slack workspace is Public(It was available on public websites). The messages we plan to make searchable are in Public channels. That means, literally anyone can read the messages. What is private here? The messages are just programmatically hidden behind authentication walls, but there is no password or secret that guards these messages. How can one call these messages private, when literally anyone on the internet has access to them. This question haunted me for a day. But before asking the question directly, I tried asked this first in Neera Workspace itself. I was desperate for the answer. So I put a message in slack, that goes this way...\\n\\n![Pizza question](https://imgur.com/qr8eMuF.png)\\n\\nYes, I wanted to gift my favourite pizza if someone answered my question! Finally, [Harsh Gupta](https://hargup.substack.com/), gave a satisfactory answer. I have rephrased Harsh\\'s answer and tried to put it in a direct way.\\n\\n## Lessons Learned\\n\\nTo summarise it- *People regard a message as private, not on the basis of whether a secret(or password) guards the message, but on the basis of whom they intend to send the message. If the intended receiver is the any individual or simply the whole world, then its Public. If the intended receiver is only a particular community or a particular set of people, it is regarded as private*.\\n\\nSo people in a Slack workspace put a message with an intention that only members of the workspace will read it. They want to have the confidence that this message will only be read by members of a particular community. You can think of it as an unlisted YouTube video, anyone with the link can watch the video. But you don\\'t want the video to be available on someone\\'s search results. In short, you don\\'t want any random person to discover it directly. Similarly in this case, the members of workspace didn\\'t want any random user using Neera to come across their messages. \\n\\nIt is the intended receiver that determines whether a message is private or not. Is it any random user or a member of a particular community. If former is the case, its public data, else you need to be cautious as people regard it as private data. Harsh gave a nice example explaining how having a secret doesn\\'t determine whether its private or public data. \\n\\n> For example someone leaves their personal diary on the bench of a public park. There is no lock on the diary, and it is in a public space, it is okay for someone to read the diary? In many societies it will be considered a privacy violation because people are expected to not read other people’s diary without permission, irrespective of where they find it.\\n\\nHarsh mentioned another point, which is worth considering about why people were opposing to index their slack workspace messages. (This can be thought of a consequence of the main point because nature of the message depends upon the intended receiver. But it is worth mentioning explicitly)\\n\\n> People often talk about non coding stuff on these slacks. For example, people give their introductions, tell their stories about their journey or express opinion about something. And they are often not expecting them to be indexed and made searchable for everyone. If they knew they would probably behave differently. And communities don’t want to discourage people from expressing themselves, so they also don’t want indexing of such messages.\\n\\nIt was hard for me to face this [paradigm shift](http://people.tamu.edu/~v-buenger/658/Steven_Covey.html). Sometimes, I feel reluctant to throw away my old logic(private data is guarded by secrets), but I have realised that it is important to know ways of the world if you wish to change things.  \\n\\n## Epilogue\\n\\nWhat is the ultimate solution to it? Do all the useful discussions in modern era have to remain hidden behind authentication walls? Will in future open forums like Stackoverflow and Reddit be obsolete?\\n\\nI don\\'t know the answers. But I am not that pessimistic about the last question, as I am sounding. But I feel that this is a problem that needs to be addressed. All the questions about latest tools are not on Open forums. The answers don\\'t appear when you search on a regular engine like Google or Bing. You have to join the Discord Server or Slack workspace, search for the question or ask on in a public channel. Opening communication tools, which bombard notifications in middle of work disturbs the [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) of the developer. There will be a solution hopefully soon!\\n\\nBut I am happy about the fact that I could be part of an attempt to work on this problem.

I am afraid that it might get wasted in useless things like spending too much time on YouTube, getting lost in random thoughts(generally happens during the college days). At the same time, I got to know about the fact that for a day, a human mind thinks of around 50,000 conscious thoughts. I still don\\'t trust the fact though! But still I am convinced that there are a lot of things that we think of randomly. A very few of them are interesting and are exciting to discuss with like minded people. Hence I felt for a need to document such relatively useful thoughts. \\n\\n# \"Relatively useful?\" \\n\\nExtension of some awesome ideas that I have read in book. A link between two different books while they speak about the same thing but at different levels and some learnings from my personal experiences and reflections on them.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nI plan to document thoughts in form of blogs, no matter how small they are! For these reasons mainly\\n\\n- Not waste time in useless things\\n\\n- Improve at expressing my thoughts: I felt that if I want to express something, I keep repeating the most important fact. For example in this blog itself, I have mentioned twice that I don\\'t want to waste my time and hence plan to blog(now its thrice!). I have seen people express their ideas very fluently, not just in their writing but also while speaking. Hope I learn that soon!\\n\\n  (So,I have thought about the above and I believe there is a strong reason why I do that. In any piece of information(may be from a lecture or a piece of text or a video) I feel that some parts of it are very important and if those important parts are conveyed successfully to the listener, the rest are just the details and can be figured out. In other words, I feel the whole information is summarized in those few sentences, hence I tend to repeat those so as to grill them into the listener\\'s mind. For example,  if I was asked to explain Proof of Work algorithm(consensus protocol used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies), I would repeat the following message multiple times: \\n\\n  \\n\\n  > The idea of `One Identity One vote` is easy to replicate using computers, I can create multiple identities using a single machine, instead to allow and individual from casting a vote, we need something instead of identity to count the votes, something that not easily available and difficult to replicate by a individual. Hence we use `computation power` , one has to spend some computation in order to cast a vote. So, for that reason to validate a transaction one has to solve a puzzle, which is computationally expensive. \\n\\n  \\n\\n  I found the above explanation in a course, and found it really helpful because for months I was wondering why the heck does one has to solve a  puzzle to validate a transaction. Now one\\'s immediate question would be \"how would you design such a puzzle\", which are details and contain some math.  And one would then show interest in understanding the details of puzzle and figure out why it is so. But in the most places, I saw it other way around, people start explaining the puzzle directly with context. In summary, knowing  the answer to `why` for me is the most important thing(most of the times) in understanding some, because the answer to what are the details and can be understood well if I know `why` )   \\n\\n  \\n\\n   \"Writing is nature\\'s way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is\" by Guindon\\n\\n  (I got to know about [this](https://youtu.be/-4Yp3j_jk8Q?t=194) from this talk by Leslie Lamport)\\n',\n",

You are arrested and as punishment were to be shot for a political offence. You are taken to the scaffold and the death sentence is read. You are given five minutes before you are shot. How would you spend those *last five minutes?*\\n\\nThis is what one of Dostoevsky's character did.\\n\\nSpend the first two minutes taking leave of comrades. Spend the next two minutes thinking. And the last minute to look around you.\\n\\nIsn't it the best way? It comprises all the beautiful things about a human life - people, thinking, feeling. I speculate that the last five minutes was a metaphor for how to spend the short life. Spend a part of it with people you love, talk to them, understand what they feel, convey truly what you feel. Spend another part of life, thinking. Thinking deeply is one of the activities that differentiates humans from the rest of the species. *You think, therefore you are*.  The rest, spend it by feeling the beautiful things around you with the sensory receptors you are gifted.\\n\\n## Not Epilogue\\n\\nIf you think the guy was shot, after spending his five minutes. Wait! That's not the end. So after spending the first couple of minutes with his friends, he attempted to grapple the mystery of death. He thought that he is now alive and after three minutes, he will be something or someone, but what and where? He felt that the sun rays would be his new nature, and he would melt into them soon. He realised how precious life was and understood the importance of every minute. He told to himself that if he was saved by some miracle, he would live counting every moment. He would turn every minute into an age.\\n\\nAnd the miracle happened! Just before they were shot, a messenger came and announced that the death sentence has been lifted up, and they were to be given another punishment. One might ask how did the guy, who realised the value of life in such intense moment, spend rest of his life? Did he really, spend his life by counting every moment.\\n\\nNo, if that were the case this story would be found in one of fairy tales, not in Dostoevsky's writings. What makes Dostoevsky one of the best is realistic depiction of man's character in his writings. The guy didn't live like that at all. *He wasted many, many minutes*. My take away, from this ending is that appreciation of life is an intense emotion just like intense love, lust, hatred, vengeance, anger. All the intense emotions are short lived. With time, their intensity fades. It takes conscious effort and discipline to maintain the emotion.\\n\\nThere are numerous incidents, where situations have changed people's perspective of life. But I think in those cases, it is repeated recollection of the idea and the desire to change that are the key forces for transformation, not the intense emotion felt due to the incident. To put simply, anyone facing that incident would have not have changed their life as expected. It takes conscious effort and discipline.\\n\\n## Post Scriptum\\n\\n1. I loathe ideas that advice that this is the proper way to live life. Of course, there is no best advice. The best advice is not to follow any advice including this one. However, I felt the idea was worth sharing as it brings out the most beautiful aspects in human life.\\n\\n2. Dostoevsky himself had faced this situation. He was relieved from death sentence at the last moment. The scene is beautifully described in the book *The Idiot*.\\n\\n3. I badly wanted to joke that I would travel faster with near speed of light so that time would dilate. But I felt that would disturb the mood of the essay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

These are caused because `apache2` is present by default in most of the ubuntu servers.\\n\\n## 1. Forgetting to Disable apache2 \\n\\nSometimes, when you try to restart/start `nginx`, using `sudo service nginx (re)start`, you see the following error\\n\\n![error when u try to restart](https://imgur.com/Aa88NvW.png)\\n\\nIf you check the logs at `var/logs/nginx/error.log` file, it says something like this\\n\\n![error log](https://imgur.com/w5ua6cL.png)\\n\\nNginx job is to listen to port 80, but when you tried to restart it, it failed because it was already being listened by some other process.  To see, who is listening at port 80, use the command `sudo lsof -i :80`, and you see that `apache2` is the criminal! It was apache2, who was listening to the 80, preventing nginx from listening to the port. You can't have 2 web servers listening at the same port 80.\\n\\n![apache2 is the criminal](https://imgur.com/7PvTFHl.png)\\n\\n**Where did apache2 come from?**\\n\\n`apache2` is installed by default in most of the Ubuntu servers. And when the machine boots, the services start in the alphabetical order. Since `apache2` comes before `nginx` alphabetically, apache2 gets hold of the port 80. \\n\\n**Solution:** Disable `apache2`, so that it never start automatically on its own when you reboot your server. To do that,\\n\\n1. Stop `apache2` - `sudo service apache2 stop`\\n2. Disable using `systemctl` - `sudo systemctl disable apache2`\\n\\nor it can be done in one line - `sudo systemctl disable --now apache2`, this will both stop and disable `apache2`.\\n\\nNow you can start nginx successfully\\n\\n![nginx running](https://imgur.com/ANypnS9.png)\\n\\n**Suggestion**: Since mostly Ubuntu servers have apache2 enabled by default, soon after you have spun your instance you can disable `apache2` to avoid any troubles in future.\\n\\n## 2. Unlinking the default page\\n\\nYou have your nginx configuration in a separate file,say `your-domain.com`, (which is a popular practice) in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`. But when you visit the site, it shows the `Ubuntu default page` something like this\\n\\n![ubuntu default page](https://imgur.com/c74tL09.png)\\n\\nThis is because the configuration in `default` file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` is given priority over your configuration, which is written in separate file. To disable the `Ubunut default page`, you can simply remove the symlink of `default` using `unlink` in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory using - `sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.\\n\\n## Apendinx\\n\\nThis happened to me twice till now - once while working on [KWoC](https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/), the other time on [project-ias](https://projectias.neera.ai/). Thanks to [Mukul Mehta](https://mukul-mehta.in/), for explaining the cause of error during KWoC. I was lucky to be present in the call as a mere spectator, when he was fixing this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '_posts/2021-07-18-blackholeblues.md': \"---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: I read Black hole blues by Janna Levin\\nsubtitle: \\ndate: 2021-07-18\\ncategories: [books]\\n---\\n\\nI recently read the book Black hole Blues and other songs from Outer Space by Janna Levin. The book is about how Gravitational waves were detected. The author takes us through the journey from origin of idea to detection. Though the book doesn't get into the technical details a lot, the story was an interesting read as we get to know the logistics of a large scale experiment. \\n\\n## What are Gravitational Waves\\n\\nNewton proposed the each mass attracts every others and he called this force of attraction as Gravity. He was never able to explain the cause of it. Einstein, revolutionised our understanding of Gravity with his General theory of relativity(GR) in 1915. The most popular explanation of GR is given by a trampoline on which a heavy mass is placed at the centre and multiple small balls revolve around the heavy mass. This is akin to planets revolving around the sun([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg)). This model explains gravity. The trampoline depicts the space, and the heavy masses like sun and planets bend the space. ([Better explanation by Brain Greene on GR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjFjC30-4A))\\n\\nTaking forward this idea, in 1916 he predicted that just like when there is a disturbance at some point in a lake, it sends out ripples, a disturbance in space(like when astronomically heavy masses like black holes collide) would also send out ripples in the space. These are called the Gravitational waves. ([Better Explanation by Brian Greene on Gravitational Waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajZojAwfEbs))\\n\\n## It's a big deal!\\n\\nPeople at LIGO detected the collision of 2 black holes 1.3 Billion Light years away! The big deal about this detection is that such a massive collision just changes the space less than width of proton. Building such an ultra sensitive instrument is no small feat! \\n\\nThe idea that Gravitational waves could be detected was seriously taken 3 physicists - Kip Throne, Rainer Weiss, Ron Drever - together called the *Troika*! Efforts of these 3 people led to foundation of the LIGO project. The book covers the difficulties they had faced to convince NSF, the congress, fellow physicists to start such a large scale project. There was still no confirmed believes that Gravitational waves were real and could be detected. So, you can imagine what leap of faith pioneers have taken! \\n\\n## Things I liked in the book\\n\\n**1. Getting to know experimental Physicists**: The Pop-science news focuses a lot on theoretical physicists for almost every discovery. They surely deserve the fame, as they have depicted how with just sheer power of human intellect mysteries of nature can be solved. But after reading the book, I got to know details of what goes behind the scenes in verifying a theory. This is really challenging, especially if the theory like Gravitational waves is still not widely accepted. Experimental Physicists Rainer Weiss, Ron Drever and Joe Weber pursued this idea seriously and began working on prototypes during the time when not many people believed that Gravitational Waves were real and could be detected. The initial chapters of the book explain the life of these experimental Physicists in brief. This book does a fair job of bringing the life of Experimental physicists to Lime light. \\n\\n**2. Importance of Collaboration**: Another important take from the book for me was that it is necessary to be able to work in team no matter how genius you are. [Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde/) is an interesting read about the same in Software Development. So, as mentioned previously the members of Troika were the pioneers in starting the work on Gravitational Waves Detection. Among the three men, Ron Drever was an amazing intuitive experimental Physicist. Here is an excerpt from the book depicting his intuitive power\\n\\n> Kip was neck-deep in a tedious, multipage calculation when Ron presented a diagrammatic solution. Ron could not have performed the formal mathematical calculation but still he could somehow see the solution in pictures, impressing Kip indelibly\\n\\nBut working together as team with Ron was very hard. He was not interested in following the team and followed his own ways. As time passed, differences between Ron and the management grew. And one day it lead to firing him out of the LIGO project, which he had co-founded. He could never work on the project again. There are cases where being impudent against authority have won(Albert Einstein!), but collaboration in Science especially in large scale projects is essential.\\n\\n**3. Rai and Kip's amazing Personalities**: As I was reading the book, I fell in the love with the personalities of these 2 physicists. Whenever there were differences between Rai and Ron, it was Kip who used to resolve them patiently. Kip though being an introvert(as claimed in [this interview](https://youtu.be/CVovLIjOsL4?t=360)), collaborated with large number of people because there was a need of it in such large scale project. Rainer Weiss was also a lovely guy! As said previously, he was one of the founding members of the LIGO project. He made the initial small prototypes in the initial days with the budget he had. In spite of being such an important member, Rai was never hesitant to do menial works like getting into tunnel and removing the spiders. Rai tried to help the project in as many ways as he could([ref](https://youtu.be/9GIsSn_LUh0?t=17)). Such down to earth stories of these great physicists are always inspiring and enjoyable.\\n\",\n",

Setting up MeiliSearch and working with it as a developer has been a smooth experience. The documentation is also well written.\\n\\nBut there is one problem! MeiliSearch fails to return when there is an extra useless word. For example, [here](https://crates.meilisearch.com/) is a Crates browser demo of MeiliSearch which searches through Rust crates. The demo is built by the MeiliSearch team and they also have a [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/search-rust-crates-meili/) post on it.\\n\\nSo when you search something like \"crypto\" in the Crates browser, it returns results within 5 milliseconds.\\n\\n![https://crates.meilisearch.com/?q=crypto](https://imgur.com/54M0s74.png)\\n\\nBut when I add an extra random word like my name to the search query, no results are returned. \\n\\n![https://crates.meilisearch.com/?q=crypto+raghav](https://imgur.com/mMWZB5K.png)\\n\\n# Fixing it\\n\\nAt [Neera](http://neera.ai/), we faced same issue was faced while integrating Pocket search. This is what we did to fix it. If MeiliSearch doesn\\'t return any result, we trim the query and resend the search query to MeiliSearch and we continue this until a response is found. The query is trimmed from both the sides. First query is trimmed word by word from Right hand side till a result is obtained. If that fails, the query is trimmed word by word from Left hand side till MeiliSearch returns a response.\\n\\nThe following is the code in JS\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst client = new MeiliSearch({\"host\": \"http://localhost:7700\"})\\nconst query = \"A QUERY FROM THE USER CONTAINING USELESS WORDS\"\\nconst INDEX = \"INDEX_FOR_DOCUMENTS\"\\n\\nlet search_response;\\nsearch_response = client.index(INDEX).search(query);\\n\\n// if MeiliSearch returns no results, i.e search_response.hits is an empty array, words are trimmed\\nconst search_words_for_right_trim = search.split(\" \");\\nconst search_words_for_left_trim = search.split(\" \");\\n\\n// Till there is atleast one result, keep trimming words from the query\\nwhile(search_response.hits.length === 0 && (search_words_for_left_trim.length > 1 || search_words_for_right_trim.length > 1)) {\\n\\n    // initially words are trimmed from the right hand side\\n        if (search_words_for_right_trim.length > 1) {\\n          search_words_for_right_trim.pop()\\n          const new_query = search_words_for_right_trim.join(\\' \\')\\n          search_response = await client.index(INDEX).search(new_query);\\n        }\\n    // if trimming from right has not fetched any results, words are trimmed from the left hand side\\n        else if(search_words_for_left_trim.length > 1) {\\n          search_words_for_left_trim.shift()\\n          const new_query = search_words_for_left_trim.join(\\' \\')\\n          search_response = await client.index(INDEX).search(new_query);\\n        }\\n      }\\n```\\n\\nWhy not trim character by character? So, if you trim character by character, many queries get wasted. MeiliSearch tolerates if there are 3 or 4 extra characters but fails, with just a single word. Hence, trimming word by word was prefered in this case.\\n',\n",

The larvae grows by consuming the living host. Isn\\'t this cruel? But nature is neither kind nor cruel, its indifferent. Blindness to suffering is a consequence of Natural selection. \\n\\nWe humans, are a result of the same slow and cruel process. So, are we bound to behave so cruelly and selfishly? When humans act indifferently, are they behaving in accordance with rules of nature? Some men misguided or with intention to mislead cite the cruel process of Natural selection to justify their selfish deeds like killing or ill-treating a set of fellow human beings of the society.  They coined the term \"Social Darwinism\".  It has been used to justify social inequality, racism, imperialism and eugenics. These were the Devil\\'s Chaplains that Darwin was talking about. Darwin would have been infuriated with his name being attached to such cruel idiotic idea. \\n\\nBut a simpler question that one might ponder is, aren\\'t we supposed to be indifferent as we are a product of such process. In his essay titled *Devil\\'s Chaplain*, Dawkins  quoting various people argues that it is the opposite what we should do. \\n\\nBy nearly three billion years of evolution, we humans have been given a brain, which is capable of understanding its provenance. Quoting Dobzhansky\\n\\n> In giving rise to man, the evolutionary process has, become apparently for the first and only time in the history of the Cosmos, become conscious of itself\\n\\nIt is as if a machine has become of the cruel algorithm through which it was built. Through evolution, we have the gift of understanding the cruel process that gave us its existence, gift of revulsion against its moral implications. So, as humans with this gift of conscience, we should be obliged to be kind. As T.H.Huxley wrote in *Evolution and Ethics*\\n\\n> ...the ethical progress of the society doesn\\'t depend on imitating the cosmic process, still less in running away from it, but in combating it.\\n\\nIn Dawkins words - *We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.*\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/sZtktnX.png)\\n\\n[*A comic from evolution.berkeley.edu*](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/misconceps/IIIBmight.shtml)\\n\\n## My favourite essays the book\\n\\nThe book *Devil\\'s Chaplain* is a collection of essays by Dawkins on Science, evolution, religion and pseudoscience.

The letter is titled - *Good and Bad Reasons for Believing*. The letter is an advice to a child by a Scientist and a Father on what should one choose to believe. \\n\\n## Interesting Terms\\n\\n- Physics Envy: Freud had proposed a term called \"Penis Envy\" which describes the anxiety of young girls on realisation that they don\\'t have a penis. Physicists employ mathematical rigour to make their predictions.  \"Physics Envy\" is used to describe the anxiety of researchers from fields that lack mathematical rigour.\\n- Spiciest: The term refers to human beings, who believe that all other animal species are inferior. \\n\\n## Post Scriptum\\n\\nThere is one essay in the book, whose conclusion will last for long in my mind. The essay *Son of Moore\\'s Law* concludes with the following words\\n\\n> ...my only anxiety is that I am unlikely to live long enough to see it. Or to extend my short arm to a new Lucy\\'s long one and shake her tearfully by the hand...\\n\\nIn this essay, Dawkins says that one day embryology may advance enough that we could successfully collect all genomes of a some person named Lucy, and the reconstructed genome could be inserted into a human egg and implanted in a woman, and a new Lucy born into the light of today.\\n\\nTo any curious human, seeing all this advancement in science happen in one\\'s life time is surely an exciting thing. This excitement is many-fold in scientists who dedicate their lives to understand nature and advance scientific development. But human mortality doesn\\'t let one live long enough to witness the progress. \\n\\nEinstein couldn\\'t live long enough to witness the Gravitational Waves detection. Stephen Hawking couldn\\'t live long enough to see the Black Hole image(Hawking and Penrose together theorised that existence of Black Holes were practical thing, and they would inevitably form from the death of enough massive stars). But these people surely believed that such an advancement was possible. Witnessing those miracles would surely have been the one of happiest moments of their lives.\\n\\nThis reminds me of the story of Charles Babbage, the father of computers. He was the first human, who conceived the immense potential of computing. He once declared that he would gladly give away rest of his life, if he could come back after 500 years and have a 3-day guided scientific tour of the new age. He would have been thrilled if he had witnessed the revolution that happened a near century later. A fun fact, Charles Babbage was first among those who battled Noise pollution. He was popular for running campaigns to reduce street nuisances on London.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-02-27-2020-books.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Favourite ideas from Books that I read in 2020\\nsubtitle: Also including my personal favourites\\ndate: 2021-02-27\\ncategories: [books]\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I learn about a new interesting idea present in a book, I read the book to explore the idea deeply and explore similar concepts and other ideas in the vicinity. In each book, there are some certain points which stay in my mind for a longer time and I try to put them into practice. In this blog, I wish to explain such ideas from the books that I have read in 2020. The reason I wish to not write summary or reviews because there are already enough of them online. I wish to list down such things from each book that I have read.\\n\\n## My personal  Favourites - What I feel everyone should read\\n\\n- Peak by Andres Ericsson: To know the psychology of expertise. The book also contains effective methods of learning a skill and acquiring knowledge. The world would surely change rapidly, if the ideas of the book are implemented in modern learning systems! To quote the author, \"we would see ourselves as *homo exercens*\". \\n- Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport: To understand the effects of social media and to realise that you don\\'t really need it!\\n- Deep Work by Cal Newport: A surprising way to be happy and lead a meaningful life!\\n- Naked Economics by Charles Wheelan: To get a good understand of some important economic ideas. The book doesn\\'t just let you throw facts. It is a kind of discussion on different ideas and how they affect us. It ignites a great interest for economics. Charles Wheelan is one of the coolest authors!\\n- Courage to be Disliked by Fumitake Koga and Ichiro Kishimi: To know Adlerian Psychology. Why you should care about Adlerian Psychology? - It gives a new perspective to look at events and relationships in life.\\n- Surely You\\'re Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Feynamn has really lived one heck of a cool life. You will surely enjoy the anecdotes, and there are many good things to learn.\\n\\n\\n\\n### ***The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*** by Stephen Covey\\n\\n1. **Proactive nature**: This is the first habit mentioned in the book. When things don\\'t go well, it is easy(and also tendency) to blame things that are around us for the situation. And hence we sit depressed or frustrated not making any forward steps. In such cases, by being proactive one can improve the situation, My definition of \"Proactivity\" is to work on things that are under one\\'s influence. For example, there is something that you plan to do it a group, if things don\\'t go as planned or people don\\'t cooperate - Stop blaming situation and people and try to figure out what went wrong, and slowly start doing things that you can do, and slowly you will find things getting better eventually. Even if the task remained unaccomplished, you will have learnt a lot and developed a positive attitude towards things.\\n\\n2. **Start with End in mind**: This is the second habit in the book. When you plan to do something, the general way people tend to start is with go with things currently at hand and start figuring out things as time passes. But a better idea(in fact the best) would be to plan till the end in the beginning itself with a proper timeline. This is helpful because it saves a lot of time as you go. Every time when at a certain stage of the process, you don\\'t have to start from scratch and you can work on improving and modifying things that were planned previously. But one can ask what is the use of a plan, if we are not going to follow it as it is. Some wise person had already answered it in this way...\\n\\n   >  \"No war has been won according to the plan, but also no war has been won without one\"\\n\\n   Even in investment, people suggest that it is better to have a bad strategy than having no strategy at all. For example, in the process, if something unexpected happens, the plan gives a better framework to deal with the unexpected things as you a have an idea of what is expected in the future, without planning you would completely be confused on what to do and it is more likely that it will lead to a bad decision. In the above sentences I have vaguely used the word planning. But to put it in simple words, start when you have a vision of how things are going to end. Though, it might turn out that things end up differently, but it is highly likely that they will end in a far better way than if you have not planned.\\n\\n3. **Do what\\'s not urgent and important**: We know the Cartesian 2D plane. Two perpendicular lines - X and Y axes dividing the plane into 4 Quadrants. With each Quadrant having a unique sign combination of pair of numbers, like in the 1st Quadrant, both the numbers have a positive sign, while in the 3rd Quadrant, both the numbers have negative sign. In this book, author the same concept to divide tasks - using the axes - \"Important tasks\" and \"Urgent tasks\". Now this divides all your tasks into 4 categories - \"Important and Urgent tasks\", \"Important and not Urgent tasks\", \"Not important and Urgent tasks\" and \"Not important and not Urgent tasks\". Now the author suggests, the one must plan a day to focus most of his/her time on the tasks that are \"Important and not Urgent\" and try minimising the tasks in \"Urgent and Important Quadrant\". It might be tempting to make a to do list and perform the tasks that are at hand(Urgent and important) and feel productive. But one must note that it is important to give time to tasks which matter in the long run - the one that are important but not urgent. By planning to give time regularly to \"Important and non urgent\" tasks we make continuous progress and it gives enough time for making revisions and also for creative ideas to strike. Needless to say, one must try avoiding the tasks that are not important and not urgent.\\n\\n### The Chimp Paradox by Steve Peters\\n\\n1. **There is not one of you**: There are times, when I hate my mind for coming up with unwanted thoughts and for distracting towards unnecessary things. On self-reflection,  I used to get frustrated thinking  \"Why do I get such thoughts???\". This book gave me a change of perspective on how mind works. To give a high level overview, different parts of the brain give rise to different thoughts, the author calls the irrational part - Monkeys\\' part and the rational part - the human(There is another part which the author calls the computer, which gives output involuntarily. Also there is a classification on the types of monkeys in brain too!). It is the tendency of the monkey to come up with thoughts and responses that are generally not advisable like getting frustrated and shouting on people, feeling emotional unnecessarily, trying to capture attention. The author explains in the book, that it is the default nature of the monkey in the brain, and one can overcome it not by fighting the monkey but by taming the monkey. For example, when something goes wrong, then the tendency of monkey would be react emotionally - shouting on people or breaking things. But if you pause for a moment, you will give time for \"human\" part of the brain to step in the picture and think what exactly went wrong and what to do next. This was a whole new paradigm shift for me on how I look at myself. Now when I get some unwanted thoughts, I try to remind myself that it is the \"monkey\" in my mind which is trying to command. All I need to do is, realise this fact, acknowledge it and let the human slowly take control over. If all this sounds strange, I may have done a very bad job in explaining things. Read the book more if you are curious.\\n\\n2. > Anything is as serious as you want it to be\\n\\n### Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport\\n\\n1. **It is not necessary to use Facebook, twitter and Instagram. You don\\'t need all of them**: It is a general tendency of people to create all social media accounts and scroll through them whenever one is free. It is somehow expected from you to be active on these platforms and respond to posts and messages actively. But do you really need it? In the book, the author introduces a experiment, where he asks people to stop using this social media for a period of month. If you seriously feel the need of any of them - for example you need to check a Facebook page regularly, bookmark the page and visit it only once or twice a day, don\\'t spend time scrolling through any of the feed. At the end of the month, you realise that anything has hardly changed, and your life went smoothly though you were not active on any of the platforms. But there is a positive side effect of this - You get a lot of free time(really a lot!) and you are less anxious because you are not having any information to react upon. The author argues that feed of these social media platforms are designed to hook you. As a result, a lot more time is wasted than you expect(You can try tracking your usage time using an app like Moment).  This has been a great realisation for me.\\n2. **But at what cost?**: Some people argue that the social media help them to keep updated with the people they know. It also helps in exploring many new things. But at what cost? To know how your friends are doing, a better way would be to meet them directly or talk to them on a call. You will soon realise that a personal chat will be more effective than a comment on your friend\\'s Instagram story. As mentioned above, you lose a lot of time scrolling the feed due to its very addictive nature. And the information you wish to gain is only from a set of few specific web pages(which can be a subreddit page, a facebook page or an instagram page). It is a better idea to bookmark those pages and visit them periodically(once in a day). That will save again a lot of time!!!\\n3. **Using social media causes anxiety.  Boredom is good for you**:  The author presents a study in the book, which claims that the number of depressed high school students have been increased due to increase in their usage of social media. The reason the author explains is that these kids don\\'t get any time to reflect on their own thoughts. Hence feel depressed, as they don\\'t understand what is going with them as they have never spent time thinking about themselves and their thoughts. In short, they never had time alone with thoughts. Whenever, they get free time, they scroll the feed and consume massive amount of useful information, most of which makes them anxious. Instead, if you are bored, stay bored. Boredom is good for you. Not yet convinced? - Watch [this](https://youtu.be/LKPwKFigF8U) video!. I personally found my anxiety to decrease as a lot of information on the social media was disturbing for me. I used to waste time thinking - who the heck was the boy that this girl had tagged? And I ended up wasting time stalking that boy!!! And free time eventually became frustrating. Not going through the feed of any of the social media not only saves time but reduces anxiety. \\n\\n### Deep Work by Cal Newport\\n\\n1. **You are happy when you spend time focusing intensely on a task**: The central idea of the book is to introduce this idea of \"Deep work\" - intensely focusing on the tasks, that require mental efforts. Before suggesting ways on how this can be implemented in your work - the author gives psychological, philosophical motivation for deep work to be part of your life. And in these pages, he claims that there has been studies where happiness and amount of focused work are directly related. And this is true, the most satisfying times are when I get to think on something challenging for days! This was originally introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi with the concept named \"flow\".  Once you realise this fact, you know how to increase the amount of happiness. By planning to spend time on more such tasks! But doing such tasks are mentally exhausting. The book offers many optimum ways in which one can do it efficiently. Do give it a read, if you are interested in learning more about productivity stuff. \\n\\n2. **Planning the day**: Inspiration is a limited resource and practically it is difficult to create it then and there to focus intensely on a task. Also sometimes, in the array of tasks, it is difficult to figure out what to do now and how long should you do it? Hence the best strategy would be to plan the day before hand. Plan what each hour of your day is going to be like. This will also help to not get lost on the immediate tasks you have at hand and will give you enough time to focus on things that matter in the long run. Read more about [time blocking](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/). The author explains that this regularity has been the key and how great people like Charles Darwin follow this seriously. \\n\\n   > Great minds think like an artist, but work like an accountant\\n\\n   \\n\\n   (The idea echoes with \"Start with end in the mind\" habit from the book - ***The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*** by Stephen Covey.  It is really fascinating to find principles and ideas in one book are used as foundation for building other good habits mentioned in some other book. And sometimes, you also find the same thing being explained at different levels in different books.)\\n\\n\\n### How to live on 24 hours a day by Arnold Bennett\\n\\n1. **Plan a day after your working day**: The book was written in 1900s, to suggest the people of England not to waste time after their working day in useless things rather involve the time in better things like reading poetry or literature. It is a very short book - around 50 pages if I remember correctly. But the interesting argument I found in the book is he suggests that planning and investing time in such things will not make you tired as many people think. In fact, it will boost your enthusiasm if you find great interest in such things. The same argument is used by Cal Newport in the above 2 books I had mentioned. This is how I found this short book!\\n\\n### The 80/20 Principle by  Richard Koch\\n\\n1. **It is really a cool idea**:  There is this famous law called - Pareto\\'s law which claims just 20% of the causes are responsible for 80% of the outcomes. The same law applies to different fields. To quote the book\\n\\n   > In business, many examples of the 80/20 Principle have been validated. 20 per cent of products usually account for about 80 per cent of dollar sales value; so do 20 per cent of customers. 20 per cent of products or customers usually also account for about 80 per cent of an organisation\\'s profits. \\n   >\\n   > In society, 20 per cent of criminals account for 80 per cent of the value of all crime. 20 per cent of motorists cause 80 per cent of accidents. 20 per cent of those who marry comprise 80 per cent of the divorce statistics (those who consistently remarry and re-divorce distort the statistics and give a lopsidedly pessimistic impression of the extent of marital fidelity). 20 per cent of children attain 80 per cent of educational qualifications available. In the home, 20 per cent of your carpets are likely to get 80 per cent of the wear. 20 per cent of your clothes will be worn 80 per cent of the time. And if you have an intruder alarm, 80 per cent of the false alarms will be set off by 20 per cent of the possible causes. \\n   >\\n   > The internal combustion engine is a great tribute to the 80/20 Principle. 80 per cent of the energy is wasted in combustion and only 20 per cent gets to the wheels; this 20 per cent of the input generates 100 per cent of the output!\\n\\n   \\n\\n   So, whenever there are too many things you want to deal with, focus first on right 20%!\\n\\n### Lead Yourself First: Inspiring Leadership Through Solitude by Michael S. Erwin and Raymond Kethledge\\n\\n1. **Solitude is necessary for a leader to make important and better decisions**: The book contains various stories from different great leaders and how solitude played a key role in taking decisions at the crucial moments in their lives. The beginning part of the book contains stories, with military background. But in the later parts of the book - the stories of Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Aung San Suu Kyi are really interesting and inspiring.\\n\\n2. **Lincoln\\'s attitude**: There are many great stories which depict Lincoln\\'s simplicity and great character. My favourite ones are\\n\\n   > When someone saw Abraham Lincoln shining his own shoes in his White House office, the onlooker asked, \"Mr. President, why are you blacking your own shoes?\" Lincoln responded, \"Whose shoes would you have me black?\"\\n\\n   and the [letter to his son\\'s teacher](https://englishbookgeorgia.com/blogebg/a-letter-from-abraham-lincoln-to-his-sons-teacher/).\\n\\n   This book contains 2 more interesting stories\\n\\n   1. During civil war, Abraham Lincoln was angry on a person as he had missed an opportunity to end the war. Abraham Lincoln never reacted or shouted on the man. Instead, he went in solitude wrote a letter and NEVER SENT it. In fact, he would  write on the letter: \\'Never sent. Never signed\\' on such letters. After few days, Abraham Lincoln was back to work in great spirits. This really explains how catharsis can be really powerful. The mere act of writing down things really cools down your head and helps you think.\\n\\n   2. Quoting directly from the book...\\n\\n      > As Doris Kearns Goodwin observes, Lincoln “possessed extraordinary empathy—the gift or curse of putting himself in the place of another, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.\\n      >\\n      > “He was uncommonly tenderhearted. He once stopped and tracked back half a mile to rescue a pig caught in the mire —not because he loved the pig,” but just to take the “‘pain out of his own mind.’”\\n\\n### Principles by Ray Dalio\\n\\n1. **Finding out mistake is not wrong**: It is generally a common notion that it is wrong to point out other\\'s mistakes or worry that if they do so, they might feel bad. But in fact you are helping your friend when you point out his/her mistakes. Generally for humans, it is difficult to find out our own mistakes. We believe we have been doing things correctly. So when next time when someone points out a mistake in you, thank him/her because you now have a wonderful opportunity to improve by acting on it. Likewise, don\\'t feel guilty in pointing out mistakes of your friend. Needless to say, don\\'t forget to be polite.\\n\\n2. **Schools  have been doing it wrong. Mistakes are necessary:** In schools, we are punished whenever we do wrong. Schools think this punishment is the right way of feedback to the student to avoid mistakes and keep improving. But we learn our most important lessons from mistakes. In punishing, the school system discourages from you to try new things, because you are now afraid to make mistakes.\\n\\n   > Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new\\n   >\\n   > -Albert Einstein\\n\\n3. **1.6x effect**: If x people are required to do a task. Ask 1.6x people to work on it. The rest are required to support the people working. \\n\\n### Zero to One by Blake Masters and Peter Thiel\\n\\n1. **An interesting insight on why competition is bad**: Peter Thiel argues in the book that competition is not good for innovation as people think. Because everyone is eventually doing the same thing. Innovation occurs when everyone does things differently as it suits them. \\n2. **Definite and Indefinite optimists**:  Optimists are divided into 2 kinds of categories - 1. Definite and 2. Indefinite. Definite are the ones who believe the future will be better and make specific plans to achieve it. They make bold and unprecedented steps and surpass their predecessors. On the other hand, Indefinite optimists believe that future will be better but don\\'t make any plans or work towards it. Instead they use existing traditional paths to achieve more or re-arrange already invented ones.\\n\\n**Naked Economics by Charles Wheelan**\\n\\n1. **An interesting way of writing**: If you had to forcefully take a Economics course in your college, and felt it boring it is not your fault. The curriculum is planned in that way to make the student sleep comfortably through the lectures. Most of the things that are discussed are the details - You are forcefully asked to remember the jargon. The book Naked economics is a complete opposite. It starts with the discussion of things happening around you and explains how concepts of  economics can help you understand what\\'s better. In fact, through out the book, it feels as if you are discussing things with the author. There is a beautiful explanation of things - Capitalism, Trade, what is money? and how exactly these concepts are useful and how these things rule our world. \\n\\n2. **Punchline of capitalism**: \\n\\n   > The market aligns incentives in such a way that individuals working for their own best interest\\n\\n   The books starts with an interesting question -“Who feeds Paris?” -  a way of asking how does the modern economy work? How is that when you go to the hotel and order fish, you hardly hear - \"Sorry, we are out of fish\". And how do these fisherman bring the right amount of wish. Who does all this complex calculation. All this works well because everyone acts in their own interest. If there is a high demand for a particular kind of fish, then fishermen spend more time fishing. The book contains many more interesting insights on different economics\\' ideas. Do read the book, irrespective of your background!\\n\\n### Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan\\n\\n1. Not to mention the interesting way of writing - Its a book by  Charles Wheelan.\\n\\n2. **Garbage in, Garbage out**: The book not only explains some of the key ideas of statistics like Central Limit theorem and p-value. It discusses the importance of having a \"good\" data. Analysis of Data is necessary but if you have a biased data then no matter how good analysis you do the results won\\'t get better. There are many interesting examples discussed in the book for example...\\n\\n   > ...In 1993, a Harvard researcher compiled a data set comprising a group of women with breast cancer and an age-matched group of women who had not been diagnosed with cancer. Women in both groups were asked about their dietary habits earlier in life. The study produced clear results: The women with breast cancer were significantly more likely to have had diets that were high in fat when they were younger. Ah, but this wasn’t actually a study of how diet affects the likelihood of getting cancer. This was a study of how getting cancer affects a woman’s memory of her diet earlier in life...\\n\\n   Again, I feel this is a book, everyone must read irrespective of background!\\n\\n**Surely You\\'re Joking, Mr. Feynman! by Richard Feynman**\\n\\n1. This story ...\\n\\n   > “The French curve is made so that at the lowest point on each curve, no matter how you turn it, the tangent is horizontal.”\\n   >\\n   > All the guys in the class were holding their French curve up at different angles, holding their pencil up to it at the lowest point and laying it along, and discovering that, sure enough, the tangent is horizontal. They\\n   >\\n   > were all excited by this “discovery”—even though they had already gone through a certain amount of calculus and had already “learned” that the derivative (tangent) of the minimum (lowest point) of any curve is zero\\n   >\\n   > (horizontal). They didn’t put two and two together. They didn’t even know what they “knew.”\\n   >\\n   > I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way—by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!\\n\\n2. **Reality was so important for Feynman**:  When Feynman\\'s wife died he was not terribly upset and he was shocked on why he didn\\'t feel so(He really loved his wife - read [this](https://www.openculture.com/2013/08/richard-feynmans-letter-to-departed-wife.html)). He explained that it was so because he had known for years that something like this was going to happen(Her wife was suffering from Tuberculosis, Feynman married her though he was aware of this fact).  He writes this in the book ....\\n\\n   > Reality was so important—I had to understand what really happened to Arlene, physiologically—that I didn’t cry until a number of months later, when I was in Oak Ridge. I was walking past a department store with dresses in the window, and I thought Arlene would like one of them. That was too much for me.\\n\\n   This was a really an emotional moment for any reader when he/she would have read the above lines.\\n\\n3. **Favourite Chapters**\\n\\n   1. **Map of the Cat**: Feynman\\'s habit of calling things straightly,  the way they are, without concern for technical jargon. As Leonard Susskind put it, \"Feynman hated baloney!\"\\n   2. **Lucky Numbers**: Feynman\\'s command over numbers. In one of the talks about Feynman, the speaker mentioned - \"Feynman was a good mathematician, and he always tried to hide it\". It is true, the world knows him mostly as physicist who is strongly driven by intuition than mathematics. That is true, but Feynman was really good with numbers and calculations.  See [this](https://youtu.be/V37eWVm-9BA) video for another example.\\n   3. **You just ask them**: You will know when you read it!\\n   4. **Would you solve the Dirac Equation**: Why Feynman gave up learning Japanese! A really funny anecdote.\\n\\n### How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie\\n\\n1. **Worrying is a dangerous habit**: I always thought worrying is a natural thing and wouldn\\'t be too concerned about it. The book starts with telling us how worrying can cause different ailments and make your life worse. It is a well known to everybody that worrying is not good mentally but the fact that worrying can affect you physiologically was really shocking for me. After all, who doesn\\'t want good health. By avoiding worry, you can be more healthier than you regularly are. Here are few lines from the book, that capture the spirit of what I mentioned...\\n\\n   > Plato said that \"the greatest mistake physicians make is that they attempt to cure the body without attempting to cure the mind; yet the mind and body are one and should not be treated separately!\"\\n\\n   > When I interviewed Merle Oberon, she told me that she refused to worry because she knew that worry would destroy her chief asset on the motion-picture screen: her good looks.\\n\\n2. **Benjamin Franklin\\'s self analysis**: \\n\\n   > ...He[Franklin] gave himself a severe going-over every night. He discovered that he had thirteen serious faults. Here are three of them: wasting time, stewing around over trifles, arguing and contradicting people. Wise old Ben Franklin realised that, unless he eliminated these handicaps, he wasn\\'t going to get very far. So he battled with one of his shortcomings every day for a week, and kept a record of who had won each day\\'s slugging match. The next day, he would pick out another bad habit, put on the gloves, and when the bell rang he would come out of his corner fighting. Franklin kept up this battle with his faults every week for more than two years...\\n\\n3. **Lincoln\\'s attitude towards criticism**:\\n\\n   >  Suppose someone denounced you as \"a damn fool\"-what would you do? Get angry? Indignant? Here is what Lincoln did: Edward M. Stanton, Lincoln\\'s Secretary of War, once called Lincoln \"a damn fool\". Stanton was indignant because Lincoln had been meddling in his affairs. In order to please a selfish politician, Lincoln had signed an order transferring certain regiments. Stanton not only refused to carry out Lincoln\\'s orders but swore that Lincoln was a damn fool for ever signing such orders. What happened? When Lincoln was told what Stanton had said, Lincoln calmly replied: \"If Stanton said I was a damned fool, then I must be, for he is nearly always right. I\\'ll just step over and see for myself.\" \\n   >\\n   >  Lincoln did go to see Stanton. Stanton convinced him that the order was wrong, and Lincoln withdrew it. Lincoln welcomed criticism when he knew it was sincere, founded on knowledge, and given in a spirit of helpfulness\\n\\n4. **Why worry now?**\\n\\n   > \"Two months from now I shall not be worrying about this bad break, so why worry about it now? Why not assume now the same attitude that I will have two months from now?\" - Dorothy Dix\\n\\n5. **You worry because have the leisure to do so**:\\n\\n   > \"The secret of being miserable is to have the leisure to bother about whether you are happy or not.\"\\n   >\\n   > -George Bernard Shaw\\n   >\\n   > \\n\\n>No time for worry! That is exactly what Winston Churchill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his tremendous responsibilities, he said: \"I\\'m too busy. I have no time for worry.\"\\n\\n6. **This small beautiful poem**:\\n\\n   > For every ailment under the sun. \\n   >\\n   > There is a remedy, or there is none; \\n   >\\n   > If there be one, try to find it; \\n   >\\n   > If there be none, never mind it.\\n\\nI made a note of some other beautiful and important things from the book in my [evernote](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s367/sh/ee4c797e-618b-ec52-b81c-86d4b3d076a3/28b93492c48fbc47d4bba2190e788793)\\n\\n### Courage to be Disliked by by Fumitake Koga and Ichiro Kishimi\\n\\n1. **Adlerian psychology**: The main theme of the book is to introduce the concepts of Adlerian Psychology, one heck of a Psychology which can completely change the way you view the world. Here is the basic idea. If you are currently doing an action \"A\", then it is because of  some incident that occurred in the past \"P\". When you think this way, all your current actions are attributed to your past, which you cannot change.  But Adlerian Psychology says, if you are doing an action \"A\", that is because you have a target \"T\", that you want to achieve consciously or sub-consciously. There might be different reasons for you to have target \"T\" - incidents in that past,  suggestion or inspiration from somewhere else. But by thinking in this manner, you realise that you can bring a change in your actions, if you modify your target \"T\" by conscious effort. For example, you tried something new \"N\", and its outcome was an embarrassing moment \"E\". From then on, your excuse for not trying \"N\" would always be to blame the incident \"E\". But if you think in Adlerian way, the reason you don\\'t want to try \"N\", is because you have set a target \"T\" to yourself that you don\\'t want to face an embarrassment like \"E\". But just by consoling yourself that such incidents(like E) doesn\\'t matter in the long run, you would be less hesitant to try \"N\" again. This is one of the best books on implementing psychology concepts in real life.\\n\\n(This again echoes the ideas like proactivity from ***The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*** by Stephen Covey)\\n\\n2. **Treating the young and the old equal**: In general, there is a tendency among people to treat young ones and elder ones differently. They mostly treat the young as ignorant and try to praise them for their deeds. This is not wrong! But when you praise someone, this creates a hierarchy in both the minds. Instead, a better thing would be to appreciate as if you would do it to your friend or thank him or her. When there is no hierarchy, people would open up and speak freely, and that would make this world a better place. This idea can be established well with the example given in the book, if a son helps his mother with washing the dishes  after dinner. Then the mother instead of praising the son with words like \"good boy\" or \"obedient child\", should rather thank her son for helping her out! Then through such small actions, the mother would be like a friend and the son would not hesitate to speak freely to his mother.\\n\\nAdlerian Psychology contains many such counter ideas, which seem wrong at the first instance, but when understood and implemented properly, brings a significant change in relationships and perspective of life.\\n\\n### Peak by K. Andres Ericsson\\n\\n1. **Deliberate practice is different from just different practice**: The main aim of the book is to introduce the idea of deliberate practice. The general notion of practice is to keep doing the same thing over and over on a regular basis, and expecting to improve. But that is not an effective way of practising. Such way of practising will lead to stagnation of improvement at certain stage. The author propose the idea of deliberate practice, which involves\\n\\n   - **Specific goals**: For example for a music student, a specific goal can be to play the piece all the way through at the proper speed without a mistake three times in a row.\\n\\n   - **Focused attention during the period of practice**\\n\\n   - **Get a feedback to know how you are doing it**: While practising, a feedback by a more experienced candidate will help you find out what you have been doing wrong and how you can correct it.\\n\\n   - **Pushing out of your comfort zone**\\n\\n     The book explains the difference between a highly skilled person and other people in any field lies in the \"mental representations\". Deliberate practice is a well defined way to improve them. A mental representation can be thought of how a skilled person looks at the situation. For example, how a Grandmaster analyses the pieces of chess board, how a surgeon analyses the situation in the operation theatre, how a theoretical physicist thinks analyses a situation given. This is a proper psychological book which explains the idea of deliberate practice firmly without any hand waving.\\n\\n2. **There are no Super humans. They have developed(a lot) themselves to achieve it**: In one section of the book, author debunks the stories which claim that some people were successful because they were born that way. For example, many believe the Mozart was born with the ability of perfect pitch. But if you dig deep, you will learn that Mozart\\'s musical training began at the age of 6. During childhood when the brain is in developing stage and it is trained hard towards something cognitively demanding, it develops faster and better. This is called the Bent Twig effect - If you push a small twig slightly away from its normal pattern of growth, you can cause a major change in the ultimate location of the branch that grows from that twig. But it doesn\\'t mean you have to start at a younger age or you cannot succeed. There are also examples in the book which depict no matter how late you start, through regular and deliberate practice you can always improve(including the example of Perfect pitch). It just requires more effort and motivation, which can be achieved if you keep doing things on a regular basis, once you start improving at a skill, you will be internally motivated to continue the practice. \\n\\n### The Stranger by Albert Camus:\\n\\n1. **It doesn\\'t matter**: In one of the scenes, the protagonist\\'s sweetheart\\'s asks him if he wishes to marry her. To that he replies  he didn\\'t mind and if she was keen he was ready to get married. Then, she asks him if he loved her, that it meant nothing. And later she asks if any other girl would ask in the same way regarding marriage, would he marry her too. To that the protagonist replies \"Naturally\".\\n\\nThe title is really apt to describe the character of the protagonist. He is really someone who is stranger to the customs of the society. In an common individual in the society, marriage is a serious concern, and they really think it as a new phase of life. But to our protagonist, it doesn\\'t really seem a big deal. I consider this scene special, because it shows how most of us consider few things super important just because they were told to us that they are important, but on moment of reflection we realise that it is not such a big deal.\\n\\nThe book really creates a great interest in the reader for the existential philosophy. The last pages of the book contains deep dialogues about the existentialism.\\n\\n> I’d passed my life in a certain way, and I might have passed it in a different way, if I’d felt like it. I’d acted thus, and I hadn’t acted otherwise; I hadn’t done x, whereas I had done y or z. And what did that mean? That, all the time, I’d been waiting for this present moment, for that dawn, tomorrow’s or another day’s, which was to justify me. Nothing, nothing had the least importance and I knew quite well why\\n\\n> I could see that it makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and ten— since, in either case, other men and women will continue living, the world will go on as before. Also, whether I died now or forty years hence, this business of dying had to be got through, inevitably.\\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-08-26-anthro-review.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Anthropocene Reviewed Reviewed\\nsubtitle: A book recommendation\\ndate: 2021-08-26\\ncategories: [books]\\n---\\n\\n\\nAnthropocene Reviewed,a non-fiction book by John Green, is a collection of essays that review different facets of human centred planet on a 5-star scale, as John likes to put it. The choice of essay topics is interesting and of wide variety. There is an essay on Sunset, one on Cave Paintings in France, one on Teddy Bears, couple of them are on John\\'s favourite songs - \"You\\'\\'ll never walk alone\", \"New Partner\". The essays are filled with interesting facts, rich insights and some emotional stories. \\n\\nWe, humans constantly want to see *pattern* and *meaning* in every thing. We look for patterns in incidents happening and refuse to acknowledge role of randomness. We want to find meaning out of every action. As I reflected on some aspects of the books, I felt there was some deep meaning hidden that author wanted to convey. Before I share my personal thoughts, I would like to share few interesting insights from a couple of essays.\\n\\n## Interesting Insights\\n\\nWhat I liked most the essays was John\\'s unique rich insight on a simple topic. For example, in the review of \"Diet Dr Pepper\"(a drink) John tells us how creation of such a drink is an example of what wonders humans can do.  A unique taste is always attributed to things obtained directly from Nature. Most of the soft drinks are just a version of Natural tastes. For example, Cola is derived from kola nuts and vanilla, two real-world flavors. Sprite has that lemon-lime taste. Purple soda is grape-flavoured. But Dr Pepper has no natural-world analogue. The taste of Dr Diet Pepper is purely a creation of chemist.\\n\\n> Each time I drink Diet Dr Pepper, I am newly astonished. Look at what humans can do! They can make ice-cold, sugary-sweet, zero-calorie soda that tastes like everything and also like nothing. Each time I drink Diet Dr Pepper, I am newly astonished. Look at what humans can do! They can make ice-cold, sugary-sweet, zero-calorie soda that tastes like everything and also like nothing.\\n\\nAnd in another essay John reviews \"Lascaux Cave Paintings\". These are Cave Paintings in France. John discusses the interesting story of how these were discovered by a group of kids and a dog. But what\\'s more interesting is that John\\'s thoughts on why these cavemen did these drawings. He writes that cavemen were no different from us(the Modern Man), who seeks pleasures in art. Though Art doesn\\'t increase any survival prospects of the cavemen, they did it extensively as if *art isn\\'t optional for humans*\\n\\n> But the hand stencils also remind us that humans of the past were as human as we are. Their hands were indistinguishable from ours. More than that, we know they were like us in other ways. These communities hunted and gathered, and there were no large caloric surpluses, so every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water—and yet somehow, they still made time to create art, almost as if art isn’t optional for humans.\\n\\nThere are many such essays filled with such interesting insights. As I read through the book, I began appreciating the perspectives of John more. The perspective and insights are not just clever, but they have a human aspect, which makes the essays more enjoyable.\\n\\n## Why only 3.5 Stars?\\n\\nAs I said, each essay is a review on a topic. At the end of the essay, John gives a rating out of 5 for the topic. Each essay ends with the line *`I give <Topic> <X> stars`*. I was curious on what basis John gives the rating. Like why things like \"Our capacity to wonder\" was given only 3.5 stars?. Why were \"Sunsets\" given give stars? \\n\\nI speculate that some of the topics were rated from the perspectives of humanity as a whole to convey a message. In a review on \"Our capacity to wonder\", John talks about our aesthetic sense to appreciate the beauty around us and be wondered. In the beginning of the essay, John quotes Fitzgerald from The Great Gatsby - *For a transitory enchanted moment, man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder*. And he continues talking about the book and its history in detail. \\n\\nIn the end, he talks about a personal incident at the forest woods, and how he felt when he looked at a beautiful Brown Oak Leaf. John beautifully writes...\\n\\n>  ....I began to look as well[at the leaf], and I soon realized it wasn’t just a brown leaf. Its veins spidered out red and orange and yellow in a pattern too complex for my brain to synthesize, and the more I looked at that leaf with Henry[his son], the more I was compelled into an aesthetic contemplation I neither understood nor desired, face-to-face with something commensurate to my capacity for wonder.\\n\\nAnd John concludes telling that there are plenty of beautiful things around that can amaze us, but its only our attentiveness that is scarce. \\n\\n> From the quark to the supernova, the wonders do not cease. It is our attentiveness that is in short supply, our ability and willingness to do the work that awe requires.\\n\\n\"Our capacity to wonder\" is a unique quality of humans. But John gives \"Our capacity\" to wonder only 3.5 stars. I guess here John wanted to make the point that humans don\\'t fully appreciate this beautiful quality. We don\\'t spend enough time or effort in being awed by the things around us. The low rating depicts our lack of effort to capture the wonder. So don\\'t let your capacity to wonder be submerged under the daily busy activities. The capacity to wonder is what makes humans unique from rest of the species.\\n\\nAnd interestingly, the first topic in the book that was given 5 stars was \"Sunsets\". Sunset is an epitome of nature\\'s beauty. No one requires any explanation to appreciate sunset, the mere sight of it *compels one into aesthetic contemplation that is neither understood nor desired*. Sunsets do deserve 5 stars, and also do every other beautiful thing in Nature - the tree, the rain, the breeze and every other thing!\\n\\n## Why no essay on Rick Roll?\\n\\nWhile reading the book, I thought about the choice of topics. The book contains an essay on the song - \"You\\'ll never walk alone\", on essay on the song \"Auld Lang Syne\", one on the song - \"New Partner\". But I wondered why wasn\\'t there an essay on the most popular song - \"Never Gonna Give you Up\"(Rick Roll). People regard this song as Internet\\'s theme song. Similarly, there is an essay on the movie \"Harvey\", one on the movie \"Penguins of Madagascar\". I wondered why wasn\\'t there an essay on other popular films - like Dark Knight Trilogy, Titanic, Inception. These movies and songs are widely loved and appreciated. More than sunsets I suppose! Why aren\\'t there essays on such popular movies and songs?\\n\\nIt is then I realised that what makes the book special is that John wrote essays on the topics which he loved. Because he loved these songs and movies as they have a key role in his personal past stories, he could think deeply about them and provide such wonderful insight. Of course, he could have researched about Rick Roll like he researched about Super Markets for the essay \"Piggly Wiggly\". But I think there would not be much he could not be such wonderful insights. Such insights only occur when you are emotionally connected to the topic, which enable you to deeply think and understand its different facets.\\n\\nI realised that one should write about things that excites her. Don\\'t write on a X topic, because it is popular or because you think it will have wider audience. Write only about things that connect to you emotionally. When you are connected emotionally to a topic, you can contemplate about it and provide unique thoughts which no one ever can. The combination of incidents you face, the books you read, the people you meet, the movies you watch; though there might be intersection in each of the individual things, but the combination of all of these things is unique. And this unique combination is a experience, which no one else has experience which no one else on earth has faced ever before in the past, or will experience it in the future. Hence, on enough contemplation, you will have a unique set of thoughts, which only you are capable of producing. Though, this seems like a glorified argument telling - \"Just be you!\"(which in one way it actually is), this feeling became more strong as I noticed the John\\'s personal stories in essays. \\n\\nHarvey is not as popular as some of the classical movies. But this movie has a great influence in John\\'s aspect in his life, when he was depressed. After coming from work, he would just be lying on the kitchen floor watching the Sprite. For a couple of weeks, John was unable to eat any solid food and survived on Sprite. One day he decided to take a break from his job and attend medication. Before he left he had told his situation to his magazine\\'s publisher(John worked at Booklist magazine) Bill. Bill left a small note on John\\'s desk which says\\n\\n> John, I stopped by to say goodbye. Hope all goes well and you’re back here in two weeks with an appetite that would put a longshoreman to shame. Now more than ever: Watch Harvey. –Bill \\n\\nIn such desperate times, John found hope after watching the movie. He could return back to his work after a couple of months.  As John writes *I have never felt quite as hopeless since watching Harvey as I did just before I watched it*. John admits that the medication had helped him, but he gives good amount of credit to the role of the movie in his recovery. John found the movie in his desperate times, and I believe that this deep connection with movie made the essay beautiful. I loved the last lines of the essay, which go this way...\\n\\n> I hope you never find yourself on the floor of your kitchen. I hope you never cry in front of your boss desperate with pain. But if you do, I hope they will give you some time off and tell you what Bill told me: Now, more than ever, watch Harvey.\\n\\nBy the way, Harvey was given 5 stars.\\n\\nIn the same way, there is an essay on the song - New Partner. This is again a less known song. When I heard this song on YouTube, almost all the comments of the video were thanking John for recommending this beautiful song. Like the movie Harvey, this song played a special role in John\\'s life. It provided him comfort in some of the painful moments, as he liked in the essay.\\n\\nThe concluding lines of this essay are a masterpiece\\n\\n> At the end of the song, I ask my son if he liked it and he says, “A little.” He’ll have a different song. You probably have a different one, too. I hope it carries you to places you need to visit without asking you to stay in them.\\n\\nEven New Partner was given 5 stars. \\n\\n## Epilogue\\n\\nThere are popular books, where there *something for everyone* in the book. Different parts of a book appeal to different people due to the varying interests and backgrounds. But Anthropocene reviewed is one of the rare books, where *everything is for everyone*.\\n\\nI give Anthropocene Reviewed 5 Stars.\\n\\n',\n",

Useful discussions can include discussions about science, literature, art, poetry, programming, economics, books etc. Discussions that other like-minded might find interesting. Here is an opinionated request - create a sub-reddit for your discussions.\\n\\nGenerally, people prefer to create a Discord Server or a Slack Workspace. Because these tools really have a nice interface, that help make discussions easier. But the problem is that the discussions are behind an authenticated wall. You will need to sign in to the particular Discord Server or the Slack Workspace to read the messages. And because they are behind authentication, search engines can\\'t index them. That means, when someone searches in a search engine, the useful discussions won\\'t appear in the search results.\\n\\nIn these online groups, many useful discussions happen. Many curious questions get answered by fellow members of the group. Now if someone else faces such a similar question, he/she would enter the query in a search engine. But the useful answers in Discord and Slack won\\'t appear in the results. But since reddit is a website of high priority ranking, the discussions and useful answers in any of the sub-reddits will appear. And hence like-minded people get to learn a lot from the discussion threads on the reddit post. \\n\\nYou can argue that search exists in Slack and Discord too. But are you aware of the Discord Servers and Slack Workspaces related to your interest? No, right! Open discussions can benefit to people who you don\\'t even know exist. This is not a new thing. Think of the impact that queries and discussions on open forums like Stackoverflow or StackExchange have made.\\n\\nOther nice things about Reddit\\n\\n- It is open(the point of this whole blog!)\\n\\n- The discussions have \"thread\" feature. It means in a bunch of messages, there is a nice way of replying to a the message you want to.\\n\\n- For Programmers, Reddit API is simple and easy to use. For example, `https://reddit.com/SUB_REDDITNAME.json` gives the results of the sub-reddit in JSON format. \\n\\n- It introduces Reddit to more number of people. According to me, Reddit is the best social media platform, one can have. The reason is, that the posts are community centric rather than user centric like many other platforms. \\n\\n  > “If Facebook is people you know sharing things you don’t care about, Reddit is things you care about shared by people you don’t know.” - Tim Squirrel, Ph.D.\\n\\nWhat are the other alternatives? Well google groups is another good alternative. I personally used google groups for a book reading club. But the problem is google groups is not given much priority in ranking by search engines as large number of people don\\'t visit the site.\\n\\nThere are some really amazing groups, which put out their work and discussions in public. I am sure that it has helped numerous people like me, when they search on the web to learn something. So, if you have any useful information in any form, keep it open. Let the spiders crawl useful stuff!\\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-12-26-1984-review.md': \"---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: 1984 is a doubleplusgood read\\nsubtitle: Spoilers are there \\ndate: 2021-12-26\\ncategories: [books]\\n---\\n\\nA reader never reads alone, even if she is in solitude. At places, she pauses and ponders on what she has perceived and communicates to a fellow imaginary reader. Below are the different things, that I had discussed with my fellow reader in course of reading the novel 1984 by George Orwell.\\t\\n\\n## Spectrum of Orthodoxy\\n\\nIn the story, the characters lie on a spectrum of orthodoxy. There are some like the Parsons on one end of the spectrum, who adhere to the rules without being aware of the fact that their freedom is being snatched. There is Syme, who is aware of the suppression and yet follows the system. And we have Julia, who does not worry about the past or future or others in the present until the rules restrict her. She is smart enough to find ways to cheat the party by acting disciplined when required. *If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones*. And we have the protagonist Winston Smith on the other end of the spectrum, who is concerned more about reality, like all deep thinkers are. Winston is desperate to know how things were in the past and wants to understand the methods and intentions of the party. He believes in the human spirit that fights to be free. As Winston puts it to O'Brien\\n\\n> In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces....I don’t know, some spirit, some principle --that you will never overcome.....The spirit of Man\\n\\n## Big Brother is not same as The Grand Inquisitor\\n\\nAnother thing I found interesting from the book was that Big Brother is nothing like the Grand Inquisitor. When O'Brien asks Winston what he thinks is the main aim of the party in grabbing away people's freedom. Winston answers that the party believes humans can't handle the burden of choice. They have to trade off freedom for happiness. He thinks that the party believes in giving happiness at the cost of freedom. And that is what the Grand Inquisitor from *The Brothers Karamazov* believes. But O'Brien reply states that the party's intentions are completely different from the Grand Inquisitor's. The party rules for its own sake. They are power-hungry. They don't care about the good of others or wealth, they want *pure power*.\\n\\n## Language Shapes Thought\\n\\nAnyone who has thought enough about words and emotions understands the influence of language on thought. Orwell showed it interestingly through Newspeak, an incomplete language that is incapable of producing politically rebellious thoughts. Orwell has elaborately explained his ideas in a separate appendix about how language could be used to limit one's thoughts. To quote Ludwig Wittgenstein, *The limits of my language are limits of my world.* One cannot express political freedom using Newspeak because there is no political freedom!\\n\\nThe most interesting part of the appendix was thought the language was capable of expressing sentences that could contain seeds of rebellious ideas, like *Big brother is ungood* and *All men are equal*; yet one cannot justify reasons for such sentences in Newspeak. They would be self-evidently false. There is not enough complexity in language to reason *why Big brother is ungood*. And *All men are equal* does not make sense as equality only means similarity in physical features in this context.  \\n\\n> A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of “politically equal”, or that free had once meant “intellectually free”, than for instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook\\n\\n## Some damn good lines\\n\\nIf its only that story that you had enjoyed, you missed the literary beauty present in the novel. Here are some of those  *doubleplusamazing* lines. Revisiting some lines and ideas from the book that you have enjoyed during the first read is a beautiful mental trip. \\n\\n> How could you tell how much of it was lies? It might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the Revolution. The only evidence to the contrary **was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different**. It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness.\\n\\nThe phrase *mute protest in your own bones* so nicely describes the discomfort Winston feels.\\n\\n> He thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed.\\n\\nWhen Winston suspects that Julia might be a member of thought police, a plan to kill her strikes his mind. But he eventually doesn't do that. It is a common observation that in fear and pain, human body freezes and doesn't respond as expected. The observation is so well expressed. Good writers describe such observations with great clarity and beauty.\\n\\n> A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! \\n\\nAnxiety of every young man!\\n\\n> He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was even a sort of love-offering to start off by telling the worst\\n\\nWhen Julia and Winston meet for the first time at the *Golden Country*, Winston starts the conversation with how he initially thought about Julia as a member of the thought police and planned to kill her. The present appears to be more beautiful because you had imagined it to be much worse in the past.\\n\\n> ... there was still that **memory moving round the edges of his consciousness**, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape...\\n\\nA snappy line to describe vagueness in thoughts of the human mind.\\n\\n> ...magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated.\\n\\nI never imagined action as simple as flinging away one's clothes could be associated with a large act of annihilating a dystopian civilisation.  A world where basic human instincts such as sex are curbed, such simple acts become powerful. As Orwell puts it at the end of the chapter the fornication *was a political act*.\\n\\n>  No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred\\n\\nFear and hatred pollute beautiful emotions. \\n\\n> If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones\\n\\nJulia's way of living in one line.\\n\\n> She had become a physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to.\\n\\nAnother line that describes the anxiety of a young man in love.\\n\\n> Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, **it’s in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there**.\\n\\nWinston uses these words to describe the importance of the paperweight to Julia. As O'Brien says later in the book, *the past exists in records and memories*. All the records of the past have been burnt and the party controls people's memories.  Hence the past has been abolished. Only a few objects like the lump of glass are remnants of the past. Hence he was attached to the paperweight despite its apparent uselessness. He believed that the paperweight was one of the things from the past that the party hadn't destroyed. But later we find that when Winston and Julia get caught, the paperweight is smashed into pieces. A symbol to depict the immense power of the party that is capable of destroying everything that belongs to the past.\\n\\n> Talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. \\n\\nJulia's character is interesting in a sense that she doesn't fully grasp the aim of the party. She is not concerned about double think, manipulating the past and newspeak language. She only bothers about the restrictions that only affect her directly. She understands the reasoning behind party restricting people having sex, so she smartly identifies people who would be brave enough to sleep with her. Other than that, she tries to smuggle coffee and chocolate that only inner party members have access to. \\n\\nWinston on the other hand bothers about humanity and its suffering under the party's rule. He wishes to understand the ideas and ways of the party and is desperate to fight against what he believes is injust. He finds great pleasure in doing things that he could do as a free human.    \\n\\n> If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love.\\n\\nThe sentence was used to describe love that Winston's mother showed towards him. A sentence whose meaning I didn't fully grasp, yet found it delightful when I read.\\n\\n> It’s the one thing they can’t do. They can make you say anything --anything --but they can’t make you believe it. They can’t get inside you\\n\\nHere, Julia and Winston believed that one's thoughts are beliefs are always their own and the party cannot change them at any cost. But towards the story's end we see that party did manage to change their believes via torture and killing love. *Something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out*.\\n\\n> In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four.\\n\\nThis line depicts that the uncompromising nature of hard science. Laws of nature are immutable!\\n\\n> ...In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order....**The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already**\\n\\nThere is a great sense of satisfaction when your ideas are validated by someone else. Finding your ideas and beliefs in a book makes you love the book more. \\n\\n> The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious,or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt\\n\\n*Doublethink* has to be both conscious and unconscious to be carried out correctly. The line explains with great clarity the thought process involved in performing something counter-intuitive as doublethink .\\n\\n> Sanity is not statistical\\n\\nWhen Winston's ideas were validated by the book, he felt that he was right though he had been in the minority. Wrong is wrong even if everybody is doing it; right is right even if nobody is doing it. But like many of his realisations, this one too changes at the end of the book.\\n\\n> The flagstones were wet as though they had just been washed, and he had the **feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and pale was the blue** between the chimney-pots.\\n\\nWinston's feelings when he was looking through the window of his hiding room.\\n\\n> “She’s beautiful,” he murmured. \\n>\\n> “She’s a metre across the hips, easily,” said Julia. \\n>\\n> “**That is her style of beauty**,” said Winston\\n\\nBefore Julia and Winston get caught, as Winston continues to observe things from his window, his perception gets deeper and deeper. He starts to find the stout woman washing clothes beautiful. As Orwell put it, *The solid, contourless body, like a block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower?*\\n\\n> Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.\\n\\nO'Brien tortures Winston to hell. Yet, Winston carries a kind of admiration for O'Brien in his heart because he had really understood Winston's thoughts and feelings. Winston's thoughts were a subset of O'Brien's thoughts. For a deep thinker like Winston, he was happy that his ideas were understood though O'Brien was his foe. \\n\\n> Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing\\n\\nFrom a non-physical perspective, a human boils down to the mind. Having control over the mind gives you control over the human and that is the sign of true power.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n- At places, I saw the novel being called as a prophetic novel by comparing the Big Brother's surveillance to social media apps' surveillance.  I feel that it is an unjust critic of the novel. Orwell wanted to depict extreme conditions and human suffering under a power hungry totalitarian regime.  \\n- The story is narrated from Winston's perspective. This kind of narration seems the best way to illuminate human condition and emotions. Dostoevsky, the master of describing psychological and philosophical conditions of man used this style of narration in many of his popular works.\\n\",\n",
       " '_posts/2021-06-25-meaninglessness.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: The one aspect in which Humans are inferior to animals\\nsubtitle: On Meaninglessness of Life\\ndate: 2021-06-25\\ncategories: [random]\\n---\\n\\n\\nHuman beings are considered as the most complex forms of life, due to the activities that we have done and we are capable of. The current world that we see around proves the fact. We have built machines that help us communicate from one end of the world within seconds, do all sorts of other complex activities like Mathematics, literature, finding out the origin of universe and so on.\\n\\nYet, there is one simple thing that we humans have great difficulty in doing it when compared to animals. According to me, it is *understanding the meaninglessness of Life*. It is true that many complex phenomenon make life possible. Though, we have figured out that the current state of the universe, we see is a result of events that had occurred in the past 14 billion years. A large majority of us have trouble acknowledging the fact. We make up stories suggesting this universe and Life has a creator, and we humans are obliged to follow rules of the creator. These rules bound us to do things, that we can do as a human being. But still, we follow these made up rules, and fear breaking them(I am not talking about Moral rules. I am referring to the meaninglessness rituals)\\n\\nIt is not just these made up rules that make life complicated. Complex emotions like pride, ego, esteem are kind of inherently part of a modern man\\'s life. Animals, on the other hand, I hardly wonder have such complex emotions. I don\\'t think they treat life as complicated as we do. Animals just live the life that they have. They eat while they are hungry, sleep while they are tired, take necessary caution to protect themselves from the dangers of external environment. Animals have developed advanced techniques mostly in the three aspects that are mentioned. But humans, have a very complex needs and desires.\\n\\nIn the current modern era, it takes a great deal of conscious effort to realise the meaninglessness of life. One has to [step outside of the system](https://rakaar.github.io/2021-02-26-stepping-out-of-system/) to realise it. I guess the reason is most of us are raised that way. The great ability of questioning things with curiosity is suppressed, before we are young. As a result, we blindly follow the rules that we are asked to.\\n\\nAnother reason, I suspect is people are afraid to acknowledge the meaninglessness of life. People do want to have a purpose, though it is fake. People worry that on realising the meaninglessness, they loose hope on living. But, I think it is the opposite. Once you realise that meaninglessness of life,  you gain immense freedom to do things that you wouldn\\'t do otherwise. You start understanding the importance of living in the present. It gives you the freedom and courage to do things that you love, leave things that you are forced to do.\\n\\nBut does that imply there is no point in doing mathematics, writing code, getting involved in literature and all things that only humans can do. As Dawkins puts it, you should do these sorts of activities because you have that kind of brain which is capable of doings such things. As Dawkins says in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWRumo75pgc) video \\n\\n> So it\\'s not the mathematics itself; it\\'s not that doing algebra helps anybody to survive. But having the kind of big brain that incidentally proves itself capable of doing algebra -- having that kind of big brain probably did improve our survival, whether because it literally made us better at -- I don\\'t know -- catching prey or finding nuts or something of that sort.\\n\\nAnother quality which I think only humans possess is the ability to appreciate aesthetics. When we perceive something as beautiful, we just can\\'t ignore it as any other sensory inputs. We appreciate the way nature works by trying to understand her secrets. A quality only human beings are capable of. \\n\\nThese ideas sometimes echo the concept of [Spinoza\\'s God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVEeXjPiw54), which [Einstein believed in](https://rakaar.github.io/2021-03-01-einstein-book/). The conventional concept of God says there is a supernatural being that when worshipped brings comfort to one\\'s life. But the idea of Spinoza\\'s God is the universe and Nature itself and praying God here means to understand the law of Universe through Natural Sciences and Philosophy. Einstein famously said\\n\\n> “I believe in Spinoza’s god, who reveals Himself in the lawful  harmony of the world, not in a god who concerns himself with the fate  and the doings of mankind.”\\n>\\n> -Einstein\\n\\nThere are 2 approaches to understand the meaninglessness of life - direct and indirect way. Direct way would be read the literary works of Legends like Albert Campus and Dostoevsky. A great place to start would be Albert Campus\\' *The Stranger*. [Man\\'s search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl](https://rakaar.github.io/2021-03-16-man-meaning/) is another great work, which tells us what kinds of \"meaning\" humans look for.\\n\\nThe indirect way would be to understand how the universe and Life came into existence -trying to understand why the world is the way we see it. In the process, you realise that the current state of life and universe though too complicated has come into existence because of the large time that it has taken to reach current state. The age of universe is 14 Billion Years and Life started to evolve since 3.5 billion years(The age of Earth is 4 Billion years). Though randomness play a key role in the process, we realise that it is possible to find a logical explanation of how things have come to exist with a certain degree of certainty. A great amount of experimental evidence is also available for almost all the scientific facts. A good place to start would be Stephen Hawking\\'s Brief History of Time and Richard Dawkins\\' The Selfish Gene. \\n\\nMost of the people who are happy with the facts they know or try to search for facts that make them feel comfortable. But there is a small category of people who want to understand reality. They devote a great amount of time and effort in discovering reality. They acknowledge the uncertainty and are comfortable with it. Most importantly, they are not afraid to leave behind what they had believed all their life, when they face new ground breaking truth.\\n\\nAgain, the most important thing in Life is Life itself. If discomforting truths cause a threat to existence, one may prefer to live with lies that are comforting.   \\n\\n[Concluding with Dawkins\\' words](https://youtu.be/2kVaM8SJlSg?t=3278),  \\n\\n> ...why should the universe care about what happens to us, but we can make our own world, we can make our own purposes, our own warmth, our own affections our own loves and we can lead a life....\\n>\\n> ...for me it seems to suggest a great responsibility to make the most of it...extremely lucky to be here the odds against your your being here are far greater than the odds against your winning the lottery so be thankful and spend your time your brief time under the Sun looking at around and rejoicing and wondering and being fascinated and trying to understand everything about the universe in which you\\'re so fortunate to be born...\\n\\n',\n",

Open in the sense, any individual can join the network, read , write and even verify the transactions. Also all the transactions that had happened in the blockchain would be visible to everyone in the network.\\n\\nThis type of model has been a great success for CryptoCurrencies and we have seen popular examples like Bitcoin and other alt coins. Ethereum is one such project which provides a platform to build Decentralised applications.\\n\\nHowever, this is not always the case we want. Sometimes we need to restrict the entry of nodes in the network, meaning only authorised individuals should be able to join a network. And also sometimes transaction in a network need not be known to all the individuals. Only the concerned parties need to update the transaction in their ledger. Along with that we may require a condition where we can't give the transaction verification rights to all the individuals. Problems like these are solved by Private Blockchains. One such popular project is Hyperledger, which under its umbrella has lead to many Private DLT platforms like Hyperledger- fabric, Indy, Sawtooth, Iroha and many more.\\n\\nHere I would like speak about Hyperledger Fabric\\n\\n### Key Words\\n\\n- **Ledger**: Ledger contains the data of all transactions. It consists\\xa0 of 2 things: \\n\\t-  *Blockchain* - the continuous hashed chains of blocks, where each block contains list of transactions. \\n\\t- *World State* - the state of the most recent transaction. In simpler words, some state which can be computed from the\\xa0 blockchain, for example in a cryptocurrency state can be a balance , which gets updated on a transaction\\xa0\\n- **Peer**: Individual in a network\\n- **Channels**: An independent collection of nodes in a network who share the same state of ledger\\n- **Membership Service**: Service that provides  notion of identity to the peers , which in case is a digital certificate which will be used to sign the transaction.\\n- **Certificate Authority**: The certificates discussed above are issued by the Certificate Authority. \\n- **SDK**: Software which is used to interact your application with the network\\n- **Ordering Service**: Manage Concurrency problem. As mentioned in the name, its goal is to provide a ordered set of transactions it receives. Hence ensuring that all the peers maintain the same state of ledger in a channel.\\n- **Chaincode**: The business logic written in code.Chaincodes can be written in these 3 languages currently nodejs, Go, Java. \\n- There are 2 kinds of peers - \\n\\t- *Endorsing Peer*: Peers that carry a copy of the chaincode and execute it and it signs the output of the chaincode execution. Furthur passing it to the ordering Service.\\n\\t- *Committers*:  Peers that receive transactions and commit them to the Ledger. They do not execute the chaincode. \\n\\n### Transaction Flow\\n\\n1. **Propose Transaction**:  A peer using its client application proposes a transaction hence proposing to invoke a part of chaincode with certain inputs and this is sent to the endorsing Peers. Does it send to all the peers. No ! It only sends to the peers which are part of Endorsement Policy which it defines along with chaincode.\\n2. **Executing Propsed Transaction**: The endorsers execute the proposal received and sign it\\n3. **Return the signed response**: Returning back the signed transaction to the client application by the endorsing peers after executing and signing.\\n4. **Sending to the Orderer**: Responses are sent from the client to the ordering service. Now this ordering service receives many such responses from these client applications. Now the ordering service will determine the order of transactions that need to be saved in the ledger of nodes\\n5. **Delivering the transactions**: Now the ordered set of transactions are sent to all the peers. This ordered set of transactions  is referred as 'block' in blockchain\\n6. **Validate Transactions**: Committing and endorsement peers validate the set of transactions received. A transaction may fail due to various reasons like endorsement policy not being satisfied or if the transaction is trying to mutate an invalid state.\\n7. **Committing and Emitting events**:- The set of valid transactions are added to the peer's ledger and the peers emit events. These events are helpful so as to notify the application that a particular operation has been performed. Client application may subscribe to particular kinds of events too so as to notify the user as per his/her requirement.\\n\\nNote that here I have ignored some complexities like.Sometimes Peers are not an individual entity in a network. Instead it is organisation which can be sometimes considered as an individual entity. Each organisation may multiple peers. \\nRegarding the ordering service, the ordering service can be a single node,which is called SOLO.  Recently the ordering service can also be implemented with Kafka, an open source pub-sub messaging service by Apache, which support Crash Fault Tolerance by which it means the distributed nodes in Kafka can cooperate can work fine even in case of failure of nodes. In fact,in Kafka even a single surviving node can operate perfectly.\\n \\n### References: -\\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBXr7dLXAbE&list=PLbRMhDVUMngfxxyVLh2t2gKDUfsOdGn56&index=22\\n- https://medium.com/coinmonks/demystifying-hyperledger-fabric-1-3-fabric-architecture-a2fdb587f6cb\\n\",\n",
       " '_posts/2021-10-02-hofstadter-style.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle:  Things I love about Hofstadter\\'s writings\\nsubtitle: A literary experiment\\ndate:   2021-10-02\\ncategories: [books]\\n---\\n\\nAfter reading *Godel, Escher, Bach(GEB)* and *I am a Strange Loop*, there are a list of things that I loved about Hofstadter\\'s writing, which I wish to express here. \\n\\n**D**ucky and Horsie style is the phrase what one can use to describe Hofstadter\\'s style of writing and explaining.  The phrase \"Ducky and Horsie\" were taken from the below comic. Simple and down to earth. Hofstadter can explain something as complicated as Godel\\'s theorem with great simplicity.\\n\\n![Ducky and Horsie](https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lse4sluYiV1qfvq9bo1_1280.jpg)\\n\\n**O**pposing Sceptical ideas in conversational style is another powerful tool in Hofstadter\\'s repertoire. While explaining that freewill is an illusion in *I am a Strange Loop*(yes, it is an illusion, read the book to be convinced), Hofstadter felt that while expressing his ideas, he had fallen into a conversation between him and a hypothetical sceptical reader. So, he dedicated a whole chapter to a conversation between 2 hypothetical characters to address the scepticism.  Conversational style is Hofstadter\\'s old friend. In GEB you find each chapter is preceeded by a conversation between Achilles and tortoise. In those conversations, Hofstadter explores the themes of the upcoming chapter in an amusing way.\\n\\n**U**nique and snappy headings in chapters is what I enjoy in Hofstadter\\'s writings. Every chapter of his books has an interesting name. And in each chapter, the content is divided into sections. At several places, we find the section headings are interesting are witty. For example, in a chapter of  *I am a Strange Loop*, there were headings - \"*Revulsion, Revelation, Revolution*\", \"*Reversion, Re-evolution*\". Under the two headings, Hofstadter talks about his journey from converting to vegetarian, to reverting back to non-vegetarian, to again converting to vegetarian. Here are a few more - \"*Flap Loop, Lap loop*\", \"*A Twirlwind Trip to Twinwirld*\", \"*Copycats Planetoids Grow by Absorbing Melting Meteorites*\", \"*Thinkodynamics and Statistical Mentalics*\", \"*Earth Chauvinism*\", \"*Number Theorists Go out of Business*\". \\n\\n**G**reat deal of time and effort to explain stuff is something which many don\\'t appreciate in Hofstadter\\'s works. I have seen many complain that Hofstadter takes infinite time to explain a thing. They say Hofstadter exaggerates explanations. But I believe that with such lengthy explanations Hofstadter is trying to make us familiar enough with an idea that you don\\'t have to think of its constituents when you have to recollect it. To explain it via an analogy, beginners learning a front kick in Karate do it in several steps - stand in position, lift you leg, aim at position, strike the target, back in position. But once they spend enough time they don\\'t have to think of individual steps. Same is with ideas in GEB. By spending enough time with the concepts, they become natural to the reader that he/she can use them without effort.  For example, while understanding Godel\\'s Proof you don\\'t have to think about the steps of mapping from a mathematical statement to a number. This is because there were lengthy discussions and exercises, which makes the idea of mapping stick as a single concept instead of series of steps. This helps us to concentrate on other key aspects of the proof.  Also, it is from Hofstadter\\'s writings that I realised that writing is not merely to state or introduce an idea to the reader. But it is to convey the same emotion and excitement that you feel when you think of the idea. Such lengthly explanations or monologues truly come from the heart of a writer.\\n\\n**L**iterary styles of Hofstadter are one of a kind. Using alliterations, occasional usage of brackets, stories related to theme of chapter; finding all these in a non-fiction book that conveys ideas about mind and Artificial Intelligence is a gift to humanity from Hofstadter. I will borrow my friend\\'s words here - *Hofstadter is a word wizard*.\\n\\n**A**nalogies are the core of cognition according to Hofstadter. He makes plenty uses of it in the book. The best thing about Hofstadter\\'s analogies they are not just used in introducing the idea, but in explaining the whole concept. In GEB, he drew an analogy between Record Players and Mathematical systems to explain incompleteness. Hofstadter went as far as making an equivalent of self-referential statements in Mathematics that could break the whole system in terms of Record player\\'s music.  And in later part of the book, he draws analogy between Molecular Biology and Mathematical systems. Only a true genius like Hofstadter can craft such beautiful analogies!\\n\\n![Analogies in GEB](https://imgur.com/csZyOkn.png)\\n\\n**S**urprises and secrets are hidden all over the place in Hofstadter\\'s writings. Hofstadter loves them. Acrostics(I found one on his own old webpage), cleverly crafted full acronyms are amusing and make you smile when you find one. Most of the times, a reader focussing on details of the idea might miss those beautiful things(I feel guilty whenever I realised I missed something of that sort).  For example, in GEB Hofstadter introduces a system called \"MIU system\". MIU stands for Mechanical Mode, Intelligent Mode, Un-mode(The \"Un-mode\" refers to Zen\\'s way of approaching things). But MIU also stands for *M*otion *I*nherently *U*nexists, which is what Zeno\\'s paradox tells us, which was discussed in conversation before the introduction of MIU. This is why, though GEB is a non-fiction book, people mark *spoiler alert* when discussing in online forums .\\n\\n## Post Scriptum\\n\\nI have mentioned Hofstadter, which is surname of 2 legends - a physicist and a cognitive science researcher. I was talking about the later. Anticipating that you would confuse among the two, I included the first name in the essay. \\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2023-06-17-kgp-additionals.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle:  \"KGP Additional experinence\"\\nsubtitle: \"additional subjects taken during my college days\"\\ndate:   2023-06-21\\ntags: random\\n---\\n\\n*There are three kinds of things in life. Things we got to do, things we ought to do, things we like to do. Things we got to do include eating, sleeping, breathing, things that are essential for survival. Things we ought to do are the ones that are expected from us - going to college, behaving properly. Things we like to do are the ones which one should try to maximize in one\\'s life*\\n\\nOver the last 3 years of my undergraduate life at IIT Kharagpur(KGP), I took few additional subjects, which made my academic life interesting. Additional subjects are the extra subjects that you take voluntarily, extra courses one can take apart the compulsory ones required for degree completion(in my case, a degree of Mechanical Engineering). Compulsory subjects come under category of things we ought to do. Additional subjects were the ones that I had liked to do. Without these, I wouldn\\'t have had anything memorable about academics in my college. Here is the list of additionals:\\n\\n1. High Performance Computing and Its Applications in Complex Physical Systems (CD61004)\\n2. Physical Cosmology (PH60307)\\n3. Quantum Mechanics & Quantum Computing (TS70006)\\n4. Computational Neuroscience (EC60007)\\n5. Introduction to Cognitive Information Processing (ET60023)\\n6. Neuronal Coding of Sensory Information (EC60004)\\n7. Neurophysiology (BT41022)\\n8. Neurochemistry (BS60003)\\n9. Introduction to Systems Biology (BT60006)\\n\\nIn a buffet dinner, you may not enjoy every dish you picked. Similarly, not all additionals I took met my expectations. But few excellent teachers offset the less fulfilling courses. Here is a bit about them.\\n\\n## Physical Cosmology \\n\\nStudying Physical Cosmology under Prof. T.S. Ray was more of an experience than merely doing an academic course. Prof. Ray was a meticulous guy, who had planned the course contents and its structure very well. Despite being an online course, it was close to a blackboard experience due to his setup. \\n\\nRemarkably, he covered all concepts of course using Newtonian mechanics. Typically, a professor would keep General theory of relativity(GR) as a pre-requisite and cover physical cosmology using GR concepts. Since many didn\\'t have exposure to GR, he had covered the whole content with Newtonian mechanics for sake of better reach of the subject. A professor putting extra work to make the subject more reachable, is a not a common thing to find. \\n\\nAnother thing worth mentioning is introduction on the first day of the course. Apart discussing briefly about the logistics, instead of directly getting started with the content, he began technical discussion with the question - *if the universe is infinite filled with stars everywhere, why is the night sky dark*. Many courses begin with the a generic introduction, where you see a slide that forcibly tries to convince you that \"this thing is everywhere, we ought to know it!\".  But Prof. Ray instead began the discussion with a simple curious question, that provokes students to think because the answer is not so straightforward but captures the essence of the course.  \\n\\n## Computational Neuroscience\\n\\nAt the time I enrolled in this course, I had just finished reading \"Godel, Escher, Bach\" and had started \"I am a Strange Loop\". Both are popular works of computer scientist and cognitive researcher - Douglas Hofstader, also a man with great art knowledge and excellent writing skills. The single main takeaway of both Hofstadter\\'s books was this - there is a mapping between patterned neuronal activity in brain and things we do. Hofstadter proposes that the complex things we humans  are able to do(even being conscious(perceiving oneself)) are because of the patterned neuronal firings inside cranium.\\n\\nI had taken the course - computational neuroscience, just at the right time. The course started with how a single neuron fires these spikes, which are a sudden change in voltage of the neuron. And how this spiking activity encodes stimulus. It was as if the contents of Hofstadter\\'s books I read had been extended to a technical discussion. The course instructor Prof. Sharba also did a good job. Most importantly, he was patient and was ready to repeat things several times and spend time on doubts. This course had solidified my interest in the field of systems neuroscience.   \\n\\n## Neural Coding of Sensory information\\n\\nThis is another course by Prof. Sharba, who also runs the computational neuroscience course. The theme of this course is revolved around how physical stimulus like pixels of light or vibrations are in air are perceived by humans. How do vibrations that reach the air give information about the who is speaking? How can a series of dots on paper be perceived as a line? \\n\\nIt is interesting to see a common hierarchical pattern the human nervous systems has developed for perceiving different sensory modalities. In this hierarchy, each subsequent level encodes increasingly complex features. For example, in visual pathway, if a region of brain encodes lines and edges, subsequent regions in the visual hierarchical pathway encode more complex features like faces. Though, the discussion is filled with biological words like *Medial Geniculate Body* and *Inferior Colliculus*, professor emphasizes on understanding of mechanisms than memorizing names. This rare approach, if practiced more widely, could make the world a better place! And also, Prof. Sharba\\'s examinations are open book examinations.\\n\\n## Introduction to Systems Biology\\n\\nThis course was jointly instructed by two professors. Of the two, it was Prof. Riddhiman Dhar, who had made my experience of randomly chosen course enjoyable. The course had a good title and I learnt from the title that it had something to do with intersection of biology and maths. So, I took to see more of maths in biology, as I had seen in Computational Neuroscience course.  The course discusses modelling of how gene networks function together. In case of a signal, like food in vicinity of a bacteria, how different proteins interact and help the bacteria move towards food. \\n\\nMost fascinating part of the course was the discussion of how a gene circuit in bacteria helps the organism to move towards food. A mapping between gene level functioning and macro level behaviour of the organism. Systems neuroscience tries to find a mapping between neural activity and behaviour. But, this was more fundamental, a mapping between stuff inside cells(genes) and behaviour. Prof. Riddhiman is a very patient guy and he put both effort and time in clarifying the doubts. \\n\\nIn one instance, he had explained a gene network model and mentioned that T-cells exhibit this kind of behaviour. I asked him what these cells were and their location in the body. Instead of just mentioning that they were some type of cells in immune system, Prof. Riddhiman explained different stratergies immune system employs and what kinds of cells are involved. The discussion was focussed on mechanism, not merely on names of cells. I am glad that in college, I could find teachers who emphasised on understanding biology at mechanistic level as opposed to simply memorising names.  I feel grateful to have attended these classes during my undergraduate life.\\n\\n## Takeway\\n\\nAll exploratory experiences leave behind some learning. From this *additional* experience has left few key lessons imprinted in my hippocampus.\\n\\n**1. Its about the teacher, not the course conent**\\n\\nAmong the additional coures, some of them were exciting, some of them were good, but some of them felt like burden. The courses that felt like burden had content that I was most excited when I had initially enrolled. In fact, I had independently started reading text book and attempt solving exercise problems before I took one of additional courses, which turned out to be a burden later. The bottom line is no matter how exciting the content of the course is, it is at the end of the day in the hands of instructor that defines your learning experience during the course. **One can learn more from a good teacher about a boring topic than from a bad teacher about an exciting topic**. Over time, I learnt to also check about the details of instructor other than checking the course contents. Its like being served a meal, that has all the promised ingredients, its just not well-cooked turning your dinner experience into a disappointing one. \\n\\n**2. Good teachers know what its means to know**\\n\\nUnfortunately, in many courses, the completion criteria is often just knowing a bunch of popular things done by popular people related to the subject. But very few realise that subtle aspects of understanding things in STEM. All the good experiences that I had mentioned above are cases where the teachers understood that teaching the subject was not just about conveying what things are, but also bothering about why these things matter!\\n\\nIn preface of a popular physics textbook(\"Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick, Walker\", as I recall), one of the authors write that the main motivation was a student\\'s question - *why does any of this matter?*. I am not just mentioning that every topic discussed, should have a practical application(In fact, practical application is not the motivation behind many discoveries. People do it because they want to understand some aspect of nature that they got hooked about). What I suggest is, behind every discovery or idea, there was a motivation of why guy/girl came up with it. Often, these motivations also give a direction of how the problem was solved. Good teachers understand this, and it is evident in the introductions they provide at the beginning of the lecture. They always talk why any of this matters? This is not just a lesson about courses, but also about the art of learning and communicating.   \\n\\n## Why bother taking extra subjects?\\n\\nMy life would have been more peaceful but less exciting, if I had not bothered to take these many additional courses alongside the regular curriculum load. I was also asked several times, why I do it? I admit that I was fortunate that six out of nine additionals were taken, when the semester was running in online mode, where you tend to have more time(time when commute and many social things were off). The time in online semester had given me chance to read wide range of books and choose additionals. But I had continued to do it in offline, though to less extent - taking only one additional instead of two.(the key reason for limiting was that I had my master\\'s thesis project in Mechanical Engineering department and I was working on other projects in Dr. Sharba\\'s lab) \\n\\nThough the time invested could have been done in other productive things like improving my main Grade or working in an online internship(these could turn out to be new and exciting experiences as well). But I wanted to explore out something new and exciting that is in my reach and I wouldn\\'t be able to get again later in life. The majority people when they say, academic courses are not worth the time, don\\'t take it; they are correct most of the time. But with a little homework, by finding good teachers, their courses demonstrate that the academic system is not that bad as it is commonly perceived, its just people make it that way. It was like finding diamonds among a bunch of rocks.\\n\\n## How to choose \\n\\nI wasn\\'t aware of even how to find additional subjects until I reached third year. If you are someone from KGP,  check all the subjects that are running this semester in ERP portal. Choose the ones that have interesting names. Enquire about the quality of course instructors\\' teaching. If the course has pre-requisite, convince the prof. that you know them. Choose one or two such every semester! \\n\\n',\n",

A good author in his writing attempts to show details of life and humans to the readers. A reader, who has read enough *good* books can't not fall in love with books and the value they provide. Ray Bradbury in Fahrenheit 451 discusses about what makes books special. It is the inherent property of the book, which is well written and well read, can have long standing effects on our thoughts and perception of life. If spent enough time with them, they can change the way you live.\\n\\n## Books, Talking, Walking\\n\\nIn the book, Faber tells Montag three important things about books, that I think are unique features of books.\\n\\n1. Books are known for quality of information. Good ones contain *infinite detail and awareness* about life.\\n\\n   > Good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her to flies.\\n\\n2. Books give you enough time to think about the content inside it. In case of television and radio, the information is thrown at you at high speed leaving you no time to think about what is told. That is why reading a book should be preferred over passive activities like watching television or radio.\\n\\n3. *The right to carry out actions based on what we have learnt from the interaction of the first two*. When you think enough what you read in the books, your perception, thought processes begin to change and some of the things start getting clear. This is more likely to happen in case of books rather than any other media because one has spent enough time and mental effort in gathering those ideas while reading.\\n\\nThere are activities other than reading that are mentioned in the book, which help you to think and understand yourselves and your surroundings. *Walking* and *Talking* are the two activities. The government in the book uses subtle steps to curb them. Clarisse tells Montag that once houses used to have porches where people used to sit, talk or just think. But later, the houses got rid of the porches. \\n\\nIn a similar manner, we find kids driving vehicles at a very high speed on the roads, which resulted in killing pedestrians(Montag is also hurt by one such vehicle and wonders if Clarisse, who loves to walk, was also killed by such a vehicle). But such an activity is not at all a crime because the government doesn't want people to walk on the roads. When you walk, you get time to reflect. The government wants to avoid that. The result being people watch the screens or listen to the radio around the clock like Mildered. \\n\\n## Some damn good lines\\n\\nBeatty, Faber and Granger deliver some great pieces of wisdom to Montag. \\n\\n> The highest form of ignorance is when you reject something you don't know anything about.\\n\\n> The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting\\n\\n> Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose\\n\\n> The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself as an oracle, is inborn in us\\n\\nOne heck of a line about human bias!\\n\\n> **Everyone must leave something behind when he dies**... A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. **Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die**, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there. It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. **The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime**\\n\\nThe above lines remind me of the word *Soul Shards* used by Douglas Hofstadter in the book *I am a Strange Loop*. Books, photographs, videos and other objects that hold memories are not mere records of the past. They are *soul shards* of people who are represented in them. When you look a photograph of a loved one, it brings out the clearest representations of him/her. When you read someone's writings, it gives you an understanding of a person's internal emotions and a sense of what it means to be that person. Though you may be physically not present with the writer, she is capable of affecting your thoughts directly as though she were present with you at the moment. That's why it is important to record beautiful moments and individual thoughts in the form of writings, photographs or videos.\\n\\nAnother beautiful thing that the lines remind me is one of Feynman's anecdotes. When Feynman was nearing death, he asked his friend and colleague Danny Hillis why Hillis appeared so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon. Feynman said that this sometimes bothered him, too, adding, ***when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories to so many people, even when he was dead he would not be completely gone***.\\n\\n> Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that, shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.\\n\\nAny quote in the lines of Nietzche's idea of living dangerously is a great quote!\\n\\n> I wasn't crying for him at all, but for the things he did. I cried because he would never do them again, he would never carve another piece of wood or help us raise doves and pigeons...or play violin..or tell us jokes the way he did. He was an individual an important man...what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he died. How many jokes are missing from the world, and how many homing pigeons untouched by his hand. He shaped the world. **He did things to the world. The world was bankrupted ten million fine actions the night he passed on.**\\n\\nGranger talks about his Grandfather here. We value people over their actions. If you love someone, it means you feel their actions and you believe that their contribution to your life and the world around you is unique.\\n\\n## Bradbury and Books\\n\\nRay Bradbury himself mentioned that the book was about *moronic influence of popular culture through local TV news, the proliferation of giant screens and the bombardment of factoids* instead of censorship. Yet, at several places, we find that book depicted and predicted about censorship of books so well.  \\n\\nBradbury is a huge fan of books. This love is apparent when you read the epilogue\\n\\n> *...breathing the finest pollen in the world, book dust, with which to develop literary allergies* \\n\\nBradbury got attracted to books and library at a early stage in life. Like all lovers of books he believes that good books can have a great impact on society. He writes in epilogue\\n\\n> ...if we ensure that by the end of sixth year every child in every country can live in libraries to learn almost by osmosis, then our drug, street gang, rape and murder scores will suffer themselves near zero. But the fire chief in mid-novel, says it all, predicting the one minute TV commercial with three images per second and no respite from the bombardment. Listen to him, know what he says, then go sit with your child, open a book and turn the page.  \\n\\n## DFW\\n\\nIn one of the interviews of David Foster Wallace, he touches upon these issues of mass media consumption. He says that with the ever increasing pace in the world, people want everything so fast. Everything is available instantly. It is very hard to sit by yourself alone in a quite room and read a book. There are two parts of you inside - one that craves for immediate gratification and the other part that loves silence. We are progressing towards an era where we are feeding the former and starving the later. \\n\\nThe interview also touches upon another advantage of books. He argues that mass media production is expensive. So, in order to get profit for your high investment, you have to produce something that is widely appealing. So, there is less scope for deep ideas that are difficult to grasp in first attempt to exposure and more scope for sex in the media content. A solution according to DFW can be that industry can be fragmented based on niche interests. In this way it can be ensured that production house will have a fixed set of people who are purchasing their content and they don't have to appeal to a wide audience. Books on other hand don't have to be made appealing! The purpose of the book is to convey what author had in mind. A well written book will always have an audience unless Bradbury's dystopian future becomes true.\\n\\nDavid's insights are brilliant! It is one of the best interviews on YouTube. Go watch [it](https://youtu.be/iGLzWdT7vGc)!\\n\\n## Post Scriptum\\n\\n- The effects of television on children is expressed nicely in the [poem *Television* by Roald Dahl](https://youtu.be/GFFJSAmXyRs). \\n- Check [this](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/27823) answer containing excerpts of Bradbury talking about his book's interpretation.\\n\",\n",

All those yaml files, docker containers, commands,\\nshell scripts confused a lot. Here in this article, I try to put those things very shortly on how a network is setup, mainly will consider\\nthe example of [BYFN Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/first-network).\\n\\n*I am a beginner in the field. My sincere apologies to you, in case there are any errors or I failed to explain properly. I am writting so as to get some more experience and clarity over this topic*\\n\\n### BYFN - Build your First Network example\\n- **YAML Files**:It all starts with `yaml` files. In case you are wondering what this is, YAML is a language used in most of the configuration files\\nfor many of the applications. Here, we mainly deal with three yaml files\\n  - **crypto-config.yaml**: Here we define the organizations,number of peers under each organization and the ordering service,which is used for ordering the transactions\\n  - **configtx.yaml**: Here we include an entry for MSP(Membership Service Providers) for each organization. In addition, we shall also include the names of organizations in the constortium(Collection of non ordering organizations that join the network). Also in the profiles section, along with consortium config you will find channel and orderer configs included. \\n  - **docker-compose-cli.yaml**: Required for booting up the entire network. Here we define the containers we requrie - one container for one peer. There is another important container - *cli* container defined here, which provides us command line utlity to start the network, create channels, join orgs to the channel.\\n  \\n- **Utilities in action**: Once the configuration is done the utilities use these config files to perform certain tasks like generating certificates, starting a genesis block, creating a channel, joining organizations to the channel.\\n  - **Cyrptogen**: Crytogen is used in generating Hyperledger Fabric key material. It means it will be used to generate the certificates for the orderers and peers defined in the configuration files.\\n  Generally the file `byfn.sh` automates most of the commands in setting up your first network. However it is when we look into the file, you understand the process of a network setup\\n  In `byfn.sh` file, you can find the command \\n  ```\\n  cryptogen generate --config=./crypto-config.yaml\\n  ```\\n  cryptogen uses `crypto-config.yaml` to generate the certificates. You will find a new directories created with two sub directories - *peerOrganizations* and *ordererOrganizations*\\n  The ordererOrganizations directory contains a diretories of each of its orderers. While peerOrganizations contain directories for each of peers. The directory for each peer or orderer includes different directories - `ca`,`msp, `tlsca`, `users`, which contain the necessary key material\\n  \\n  - **Configtxgen**: The configtxgen command allows users to create and inspect channel config related artifacts. The content of the generated artifacts is dictated by the contents of `configtx.yaml`(definition in docs, self explainatory)\\n      - *Creating a genesis block*: The genesis block is the first block in the blockchain. In Fabric, the genesis block contains information about the channel. \\n      ```\\n        configtxgen -profile SampleMultiNodeEtcdRaft -channelID byfn-sys-channel -outputBlock ./channel-artifacts/genesis.block\\n      ```  \\n        The above commands creates a genesis block in the `channel-artifacts` folder. `SampleMutliNodeEtcDraft` indicates to generate genesis block for a raft ordering service. `byn-sys-channel`  indicates the name of the channel which is used to indicate by the flag `-channelID`\\n      - *Creating a channel configuration Transaction*: The channel configuration file `channel.tx` contains a definitions for our sample channel\\n      ```\\n      ../bin/configtxgen -profile TwoOrgsChannel -outputCreateChannelTx ./channel-artifacts/channel.tx -channelID mysamplechannel\\n      ```\\n      (I am deliberately skipping the anchor peers part, as a network can be setup without anchor peers too)\\n \\n - **Furthur Steps**      \\n     - *Starting the Network*: `docker-compose`(A tool to run multi container Docker applications) shall be used here to start the containers\\n      ```\\n      docker-compose -f docker-compose-cli.yaml -f docker-compose-etcdraft2.yaml up\\n      ```\\n      You can check that the containers are running by using the command \\n      ```\\n      docker ps -a\\n      ```\\n      - *Creating the channel*: To create a channel we must be able to enter the cli command tool, we do that by running the command\\n      ```\\n      docker exec -it cli bash\\n      ```\\n      - *Creating  a channel* : Now to create a channel, we pass the channel configuration transaction, channel name, ca-certs to the orderer\\n      ```\\n      peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c mysamplechannel -f ./channel-artifacts/channel.tx --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem\\n      ```\\n      - *Join Peers to channel*:\\n      Set the following as environment variables. This is required so as to join peers to the channel\\n      ```\\n      CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp\\n      CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051\\n      CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=\"Org1MSP\"\\n      CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt\\n      ```\\n      Use the following command to add peer0 to the channel\\n      ```\\n      peer channel join -b mychannel.block\\n      ```\\n      Similarly you need to set environment variables for other peers so as to add them,Instead you can write a script like [this](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ialberquilla/4fd5a94fba3a73e7893b43f3eebca709/raw/a6dc73759b87b544cb1bb850555f8c4f2748faeb/join-peer.sh)\\n      to add peers to the channel\\n      \\n*We are done with setting up a network - a channel with peers joined :)* \\n      \\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-08-12-for-fun.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Why don\\'t we play for fun?\\nsubtitle: \\ndate: 2021-08-12\\ncategories: [random]\\n---\\n\\n![Indoor Foosball](https://imgur.com/aLGxgMF.png)\\n\\nA few days back, I had visited a mall, where we discovered this amazing game called Foosball. Its like football as a indoor game. As you can see in the above image, there are rods, which can be moved in a single direction. You can make the ball move using those human dolls, which can be rotated about the axis of rod. Its a game played by 2 teams, and each team has 2 players. On each side, each team member holds his/her rods and tries to score a goal by moving the rods back and forth and frequently rotating it to make the human doll hit the ball. The one near the goal is defender and the other is the attacker.\\n\\nFor most of us this was new, and we really enjoyed it when we tried this. After sometime, we split into 2 teams and began playing a friendly match. I was the defender. In one of the games, we were leading the game with 2-0. I suddenly felt that since a long time I was only at the defender position. For a change, I wanted to play at the attacker\\'s position. So, I asked with my team mate for exchange of places to which he agreed. When he was the defender, my friend couldn\\'t defend a couple of goals. Immediately, after that he told in a low voice *I am not good at this position, we are loosing, lets shift positions*. To which I replied, *Does it matter? Why don\\'t we play for fun* and I continued at the attacker\\'s position.\\n\\nThis was not the first time such a thing happened. Many times I have noticed people play games with a intention of winning, but not with an intention of enjoying the game. I always wondered why people take winning and loosing a game seriously, where they literally don\\'t have anything to loose or win. I don\\'t blame people for having a competitive nature, but I feel bad for the people who play a game only for sake of winning miss out a lot of fun. \\n\\nNevertheless, my concern was what makes people to take winning in casual games so seriously. And it is not just about games. We tend to look almost many things life like these games, where the focus is on winning the game. This reminded me of an [Aaron\\'s blog](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong) where he speaks about how schools has made the concept of failing a miserable thing. How the system has made people afraid to try new things because they are afraid to fail. Aaron tells that the solution to it is to **detach people\\'s actions from their worth**. In his words...\\n\\n> The real piece, it would seem, is finding some way to detach a student’s actions from their worth. The reason failing hurts is because we think it reflects badly on us. I failed, therefore I’m a failure. But if that’s not the case, then there’s nothing to feel hurt about\\n\\nIn this case, winning and loosing affect people\\'s thoughts about themselves. Winning attaches a sense of worth and loosing attaches a sense of disdain. Why do most of the people think that way? I guess, that is because schooling system encouraged them to think of every thing as a race. The atmosphere of the classroom rarely encourages you to enjoy the process of learning. Instead the focus is laid on cracking the exam. They are encouraged to look their fellow learners as competitors. The ones at the top of the marks list are adulated and the ones at the bottom are despised. So, people continue to look other aspects of life the same way. Almost in every aspect of life, the goal becomes to defeat someone or be better than most of them or seek validation from people, but not to enjoy the journey.\\n\\nI don\\'t know the solution to this. But I am sure of one thing, that it is a horrible way to lead life, at least for me.\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n- Seeking validation is not a bad thing. Our brain wanting to seek validation from other people is due to evolutionary reasons. Humans used to stay together and hunt for food in groups. It was important in those days to be a part of group, to stay safe from other predators and have food. Staying in a group increased your prospects of survival. Hence, humans want to seek validation so that they want to be accepted as a part of the \"group\". But doing things for the sole purpose of seeking someone\\'s validation is awful.\\n- Source of Foosball table image - https://www.pinterest.com/pin/542965298809586218/\\n\\n\\n',\n",

So when you are expecting that you are assigning 1 to `myNum` because `p` contains address of `i`, whose value is 1, is actually no longer 1 but has been incremented to 2; by the `main thread`.\\n\\n\\nThis is called Data Race or Race condition where a variable is being read by one thread, and the variable\\'s value is being written(altered) by other thread.\\nNow how do we avoid it\\nStore it in a variable(an array preferably here) which isn\\'t altered and pass it as argument in pthread_create.  Because though i will be altered the value which we want has been copied into a array cell which is not going to be changed. The code would be in this manner:\\n\\n\\n```\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n#include <pthread.h>\\n\\n#define NUM_THREADS 4\\n\\nvoid *threadFunc(void *pArg) { /* thread main */\\n\\tint myNum = *((int*)pArg);\\n\\tprintf(\"Thread number %d\\\\n\", myNum);\\n\\treturn 0;\\n}\\n\\nint main(void) {\\n\\n\\tint i;\\n\\tint tNum[NUM_THREADS];\\n\\tpthread_t tid[NUM_THREADS];\\n\\t\\n\\tfor(i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) { /* create/fork threads */\\n\\t\\ttNum[i] = i;\\n\\t\\tpthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, threadFunc, &tNum[i]);\\n\\t}\\n\\t\\n\\tfor(i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) { /* wait/join threads */\\n\\t\\tpthread_join(tid[i], NULL);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treturn 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n',\n",

And the final state of 2 qubits can be thought of as $$ \\\\begin{bmatrix}ac & ad & bc & bd \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}^{T} $$   $$\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle & \\\\vert 01 \\\\rangle & \\\\vert 10 \\\\rangle & \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} $$\\n\\nNow if you want to know the state of the system, you need to measure the first qubit and then the second qubit. Then it would collpase in one of the following - 00, 01, 10, 11.\\n\\nWhat if I said there exists a system of 2 qubits, where after measuring the first qubit itself, you can tell whether the system is in 00, 01, 10 or 11. That means, just one measurement is enough to determine the state of the system. Such states are called entangled states, there are more interesting things about entanglement, but lets define the math first.\\n\\nIf it is not possible to write the state of a system as a tensor product of 2 states, then we can call them as entangled state. For example, \\n\\n$$\\\\dfrac{ \\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 01 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ can be written as $$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$  $$ \\\\otimes $$  $$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 1 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ \\n\\n$$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 10 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ can be written as $$\\\\vert 1 \\\\rangle $$  $$ \\\\otimes $$   $$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 1 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ \\n\\nNow what about \\n\\n$$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ ?\\n\\nLets see  (a $$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$  + b$$ \\\\vert 1 \\\\rangle $$ ) $$ \\\\otimes $$  (c$$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$  + d $$ \\\\vert 1 \\\\rangle $$ ) = ac $$ \\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle$$ + ad$$ \\\\vert 01 \\\\rangle$$ + bc$$ \\\\vert 10 \\\\rangle$$ + bd$$ \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle$$  =  $$\\\\dfrac{ \\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$\\n\\nby comparing we get \\n\\n$$ ac =  \\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} $$,\\n\\n$$ bd =  \\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} $$,\\n\\n$$ ad = 0 $$,\\n\\n$$ bc = 0 $$\\n\\nif ad  = 0 then one of a or d has to be zero, \\n\\nlets see ,if $$a$$ is zero then $$ac$$ has to be zero, and can\\'t be equal to $$\\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$, hence $$a$$ is not zero\\n\\nand if $$d = 0$$, then bd has to be equal to zero, but $$ bd $$ was expected to be equal to $$\\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$, hence $$d$$ is also not zero\\n\\nsince its contradicting, no values of a,b,c,d exist. Hence $$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ is an entangled state\\n\\nSimilarly,$$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ , $$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 01 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 10 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ , $$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 01 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 10 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ are also entangled states.\\n\\nSome extra info:-\\n\\n- Infact they are given special names called Bell States.\\n\\n- $$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle + \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ is denoted by $$ \\\\vert + \\\\rangle $$, and $$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle - \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ is denoted by $$ \\\\vert - \\\\rangle $$\\n\\n## What\\'s the big deal\\n\\nSo, that means if you measure the first qubit, you automatically know what the result of second qubit\\'s measurement. Itseems as if the particles are comunicating...\\n\\n\"Hey, I collapsed to zero state, you collapse at zero too\"\\n\\nThis \"fundamental\" property is exploited for communication using qubits. The interesting part is this doesn\\'t depend on the distance between the qubits. For example, there is an entangled pair of $$ \\\\vert + \\\\rangle $$. Person \"A\" takes a qubit from the pair and goes to moon. And Person \"B\" is having other qubit of the pair with her on the earth. After A measures and finds it 0, then immediately after B measures she finds it 0 too! Is it just a hoax? No! Experimentally, it has been verified for a distance of around 500 kilometers [ref](https://www.livescience.com/28550-how-quantum-entanglement-works-infographic.html#:~:text=A%20proposed%20experiment%20would%20send,that%20has%20been%20experimentally%20tested.). \\n\\nNow, imagine the particles are far away from each other(very far, say the distance between 2 galaxies), we measure the second particle just after a split second, they does that mean that particles have communicated at a speed greater than the speed of light?, which states the theory of relativity is wrong.  Einstein help develop this paradox(called EPR paradox) to prove Quantum Mechanics as an incomplete theory. He called entanglement as \"Spooky Action at a distance.\" Instead  EPR proposed a theory of hidden variables, which suggested that at inception of particles itself, their states were hidden. That means their states are pre-determined  and are hidden in the variables. Later came an Irish Physicist John Bell who proved the theory of hidden variables wrong. Checkout Bell\\'s theorem for more.\\n\\n## Preparing an entangled pair\\n\\nLet\\'s prepare an entangled pair - $$ \\\\vert + \\\\rangle $$. \\n\\nYou have 2 qubits  both intitall set to $$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$ . Hence their state would be $$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$ $$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$ .Apply Hadamard gate to the first qubit, then the state would be represented as \\n\\n  $$H( \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle)$$ $$ \\\\otimes $$  $$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$  = $$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$  + $$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle +  \\\\vert 1 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$ $$ \\\\otimes $$  $$ \\\\vert 0 \\\\rangle $$  = $$ \\\\vert\\\\dfrac{ \\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle +  \\\\vert 10 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$\\n\\nNow apply CNOT gate by considering first qubit as controlled bit and second one as target bit\\n\\n(CNOT gate: if controlled bit is 0, target bit remains as it is. If control bit is 1, target bit is flipped)\\n\\nThat state now becomes $$\\\\dfrac{ \\\\vert 00 \\\\rangle +  \\\\vert 11 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$\\n\\n(*Explanation*:\\n\\n$$\\\\dfrac{\\\\vert **0**0 \\\\rangle +  \\\\vert **1**0 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}}$$, here after CNOT as described above, the bit after **1** is flipped.

Victor Frankl developed the concept of Logotherapy, in which neurosis(mental disorder involving stress) is treated by helping patient to find a meaning in his/her life, to live by. The first half of the book contains Author\\'s experiences and events in Auschwitz Concentration Camp. The author being a doctor, gives a psychological take on the events. Among these lines, there are many valuable and interesting ideas, and I wish to write a subset of them below.\\n\\n- Dostoevsky\\'s dialogues\\n\\n  - **The definition of man is the one who can get used to anything:** In Auschwitz, people got habituated to minimal food and sleep despite of medical facts claim it is impossible for a man to live in such conditions\\n  - **The only thing  I fear is not being worthy of deeds**: Suffering is inevitable, it is in the phase of suffering that one must use it as an opportunity for inner achievement.\\n\\n- Last of Human\\'s Freedom\\n\\n  - The last of human\\'s freedom - to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way\\n\\n    People in camps, were given very low food, had improper sleep, unhygienic living conditions. Despite all these sufferings, there were \"saints\", who chose to not become victim of conditions around. There were people, who would still give up their last piece of bread to others to save them.\\n\\n- Logotherapist is a ophthalmologist, not a painter: In other type of therapies, the therapist guides the world as he sees it as and asks the patient to change his point of view. But a logotherapist on the other hand attempts to broaden the visual field of the patient helping him/her to find the meaning by himself. There is one answer to \"What is the meaning of Life?\", the question is equivalent to asking a Chess Grandmaster \"What is the best move in a Chess game?\"\\n\\n- Meaning can be achieved in 3 ways\\n\\n  - Creative work or good deeds\\n  - Encountering something or someone you love\\n  - Facing Unavoidable suffering and rising above it\\n\\n- When there is a lack of meaning, sexual libido becomes rampant...\\n\\n  ```\\n  there are various masks and guises under which the \\n  existential vacuum appears. Sometimes the frustrated will to meaning is \\n  vicariously compensated for by a will to power, including the most \\n  primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, \\n  the place of frustrated will to meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. \\n  That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual \\n  compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido \\n  becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.\\n  ```\\n\\n- As per Schopenhauer, Man oscillates between Distress and Boredom, one has to find a meaning in life to overcome these. \\n\\n- Last lines of the book:\\n\\n  ```\\n   Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of.\\n  \\n    And since Hiroshima we know what is at stake.\\n  ```\\n\\n- Death in Tehran Story: This is an interesting story mentioned in the book, which goes this way...\\n\\n  > Once a Rich guy was taking a walk in his garden leisurely. One of his servant comes panicking and tells that he has encountered death and was threatened by him. He asks his master for the fastest horse, so that he can flee to Tehran tonight. The master being a kind guy, gives his servant the fastest horse. Later that day, the death meets master himself and the master asks death why he had threatened his servant. The death replies that he had no intention to threaten the servant, he just expressed his astonishment to the servant. The king asked death why he was astonished. The death says he was astonished to find the servant here, and wanted to know what he was doing here, because he had a appointment with the death that night in Tehran!\\n\\n  There are different interpretations of this story. One simple interpretation which I like is; things like pain, suffering and death are inevitable events. There is no pointing in trying to run away from them. One has to face them, understand the reality and use them as an opportunity for inner achievement.\\n\\n\\n  \\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-07-23-use-rss.md': \"---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: RSS is underrated\\nsubtitle: Why you should use RSS\\ndate: 2021-07-23\\ncategories: [random]\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n*If you are not familiar with RSS, I recommend you to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HNUqDL-pI8) video by Growth Origin.*\\n*Both the web standards - RSS and Atom are equally good. You can use any one of them. The purpose of this blog is to explain the importance of such standards, not to comapre between them* \\n\\nIn simple words, RSS is a protocol that allows users to access updates from different websites. The best part about RSS is that it's a protocol. As I have mentioned in my [previous blog](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-07-07-protocols-vs-platforms/), protocols solve many problems that are common today due to large centralized platforms. The essay [Protocols, Not Platforms](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech) explains the same in detail. The basic argument is current platforms are centralized and there is too much power in the hands of companies. Many individuals feel that feed on these platforms is noisy. It is filled with hate speech. Also, the value obtained from the feed to time spent ratio is low.\\n\\nI feel that RSS can be a solution to the above problems. If more people start using RSS, we will be able to share valuable ideas with less noise. So, here is the utopia, that I have dreamt of. Instead of people posting their thoughts on platforms, they write them down on their blogs. And individuals interested in learning their thoughts can subscribe to their blogs via RSS feed. In this case, you don't have to open a disturbing feed. You can only read from the people, whom you want. The best part about it is, it supports diversity. Individuals can blog anywhere - CMS like WordPress, personal website setup using Static Site Generators. And readers too can use any RSS reader of their interest. There is no restriction on the content providers and content consumers to stick to a particular platform. A Reader can change the RSS reader and the writer can change his/her site any number of times, provided the RSS feed URL remains the same.\\n\\nBut one can complain - why do I have to write a blog to share my shower thought. I have 2 arguments\\n\\n1. A blog doesn't have to be lengthy read. There is nothing wrong with a blog with character length less than 280.\\n2. May be, this can be an excuse to think more about the idea, and express it in great detail.\\n\\nThis is really an effective way. I follow many blogs of my friends from [KOSS](https://facebook.com/kossiitkgp), and I have been loving the experience.\\n\\n## RSS in current scenario\\n\\nYou don't have to wait till all the people you like set up their blogs. Many popular websites support RSS. Here are ways, you can use RSS to follow content on different popular platforms at one place. For example, you can get updates from your favourite substack writer, YouTuber, subreddit all at one place via RSS. Here are ways how you can get RSS feed from popular websites\\n\\n- **Reddit**\\n  - RSS feed for a subreddit - https://reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT.rss\\n  - RSS feed for a user - https://reddit.com/user/USERNAME.rss\\n  - RSS feed for multiple subreddits - https://reddit.com/r/SUB1+SUB2.rss\\n  - Front page - https://www.reddit.com/.rss\\n- **YouTube**\\n  - Each channel link itself is an RSS feed. For example https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw, which is link for 3b1b YouTube channel is also link for its RSS feed\\n- **Substack**\\n  - Adding `/feed` for the substack main page gives the RSS feed of the newsletter. For example https://ava.substack.com/feed is the feed for Ava from Bookbear express, whose substack main page is https://ava.substack.com/feed\\n- **Medium**\\n  - `https://medium.com/feed/PUBLICATION-NAME` is the RSS feed for a medium account. For example https://medium.com/feed/semi-technologies is the RSS feed for https://medium.com/semi-technologies\\n\\n- **Trial and Error**\\n  - Most of the websites have RSS, though link for the feed may be not explicitly available on the site. Suppose, you want to find the RSS feed  for `https://domain.com`, it is likely that link for RSS feed can be one of these -   `https://domain.com/index.xml`, `https://domain.com/feed.xml`, `https://domain.com/atom.xml`.\\n\\nFor more\\n\\n- [How to create RSS feed of popular websites by Spians Labs](https://medium.com/@spians/how-to-get-rss-feed-of-popular-websites-c5cb2af83d71)\\n- [How to Find the RSS Feed URL for Almost Any Site by Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-find-rss-feed-url/)\\n- [Using Reddit content as Newsletter](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/rss#wiki_can_i_use_reddit_as_a_newsreader.3F)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '_posts/2021-08-21-infinites.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Not all Infinities are same\\nsubtitle: The genius of George Cantor\\ndate: 2021-08-21\\ncategories: [math]\\n---\\n\\nFew months back, while reading Emperor\\'s new mind by Roger Penrose, I learnt a counter-intuitive mathematical fact, which I felt was interesting to share. We all are familiar with different types of numbers. The most common ones we use are \\n\\n- Natural Numbers: Used for counting in daily life. Lets denote by **N**\\n\\n  0, 1, 2, 3, 4... \\n\\n- Integers: Natural numbers along with their negative counterpart. Let\\'s denote this set using **Z**\\n\\n  ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...\\n\\n- Fractions: Numbers in the form of p/q, where p, q are integers and q is not zero. To be precise, they are called Rational numbers. Lets denote this using the set **Q**\\n\\n  ....-5....-2/3....-1/4...0.....1/5....7/8....2/1....\\n\\n  We know that each set of Numbers is an infinite set. That is, there are infinite number of natural numbers, infinite number of integers and also infinite number of fractions. Now, is it possible to compare their size? Can you say, which infinite set is a larger one? By intuition, one might rush to conclude that number of Integers is larger than number of natural numbers because integers contain natural numbers along with negative counter part. Also, intuition tells us that number of Fractions is larger than number of integers because they contain integers as well as all the numbers in between them.\\n\\n  But here is a surprising truth- they all are of same size! Number of Natural numbers is same as number of Integers, which is same as number of rational numbers. The key thing to note that these all are infinite sets, and you can\\'t rely on the intuition, which was used to compare sets of finite elements.\\n\\n  When you want to compare finite sets it is easy to tell whether they are of same size are not. Just count elements in both the sets, check if they are equal or not. But in case of infinite sets, you can\\'t count the size. Hence to compare 2 infinite sets, we use clever technique- finding one to one correspondence between the 2 infinite sets. \\n\\n  Here is a useful analogy. You have two baskets. One contains apples and the other contains oranges. If the number of apples and number of oranges are same, then for each unique apple, there is a corresponding unique orange. Suppose for a unique apple, there is no corresponding orange, then it means number of apples are larger than number of oranges. We do the same with numbers! It is using this idea, that we prove some counter-intuitive facts below.\\n\\n## Size of Integers same as Size of Natural Numbers\\n\\nAs discussed above, to prove that number of integers is same as number of natural numbers, we find a one to one correspondence between integers and natural numbers. That is for each unique integer, there is a unique natural number. Now, below is the generalisation of the correspondence.\\n\\n![Generalisation of Correspondence](https://imgur.com/A7dPixk.png)\\n\\nIntegers(**Z**) consist of zero, positive natural numbers, negative natural numbers  Natural numbers(**N**) consist of zero, even numbers, and odd numbers. So in the above above correspondence, we have shown that zero in **Z** corresponds to zero in **N**. Every negative number in **Z** has a corresponding unique odd number in **N**. Similarly, every positive number in **Z** has a corresponding unique number in **N**. You can see the same correspondence enumerated below.\\n\\n![Enumerated below Z and N correspondence](https://i.imgur.com/taOO9aK.png)\\n\\nAs we can see above, for every integer, there is a corresponding unique Natural Number. For every apple, there is a corresponding unique orange! Hence both the sets are of same size.\\n\\n## Size of Natural numbers is same as Size of Fractions\\n\\nNow, this is not straight forward, but also not hard. It is a smart proof, as you will see. Write all the fractions with denominator as 1 in a row like below. Obviously you can\\'t write all of them as there are infinite of them.\\n\\n![1/1 -1/2 2/1 -2/1 ...](https://imgur.com/elb2x4S.png)\\n\\n And then in the next row write all the fractions with denominator 2. Then fill the next row with denominator 3. And so on...\\n\\n![Grid](https://imgur.com/l7ZVbAh.png)\\n*Grid containing all the fractions*\\n\\nNow below we have a grid containing all the fractions except zero. But note that there are repetitions. For example all the   one(1) appears in every row - 1/1, 2/2, 3/3 .... You can find half(1/2) in alternate rows rows - 1/2, 2/4.. Similarly there are many other fractions repeated, which are marked in Red.\\n\\n![Marked in Red](https://imgur.com/8ymjxkW.png)\\n\\n*Repeated Fractions marked in Red*\\n\\nNow our goal is to prove that number of Natural numbers and number of fractions are same. Liked we did it previously, all we need to do is find a one-to-one correspondence between fractions and natural numbers. \\n\\nFirst the simplest part, Zero in Fractions corresponds to Zero in Natural numbers. Now we are left with finding a correspondence between the remaining fractions in the grid and Natural Numbers from one. The way we do this is by finding a path in the grid to cover all the fractions in the grid. And each point in the grid(a fraction here) covered will have a corresponding natural number as its index. To simplify, you start counting each point you visit. Since your path will cover all the fractions and each fraction has a corresponding Natural Number as its index. the one to one correspondence between fractions and Natural numbers is established. \\n\\nNow how do we find such a path? Say, we start with first number in the first row(1/1) and start moving in horizontal direction towards right. Will this path cover all the points in the grid? No, because the first row contains infinite fractions, you will never reach the next row and you will miss out all the subsequent rows. You can\\'t cover all the points by moving in horizontal direction.\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/vVKsAJ2.png)\\n\\n*Sad Missing Rows*\\n\\nSimilarly, suppose starting from 1/1 we move vertically towards bottom. In this way, we will never reach the next column as the first column is infinitely long. You can\\'t cover all the points by moving in vertical direction.\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/8I9LYh0.png)                     \\n\\n*Sad missing columns*\\n\\nNeither strictly horizontal nor strictly vertical path directions cover all the points in the grid. So, instead we move in both directions - that is we move diagonally!. As shown in the below image, we start from 1/1 and move diagonally. \\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/HOu6L0x.png)\\n\\n*Diagonal is the only way!*\\n\\nAs you can see we are not stuck in any of single row or a single column like in previous cases. And this way, you will have covered every fraction in the grid. For every fraction we visit, we assign it a corresponding Natural Number. That is 1/1 has a index 1, the next fraction -1/1 has index 2, the next fraction 1/2 has index 3. So, each fraction has a corresponding Natural Number as its index. And hence, we have seen that every fraction has a corresponding unique Natural Number. Note that while traversing we have avoided the repeated fractions.\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/eTwZdxX.png)\\n\\n*Mapping between Fractions and Real Numbers*\\n\\nPreviously, we saw that the number of Natural Numbers is same as number of Integers. Now we saw that the number of Natural numbers is same as number of Fractions. So, here we have proved a counter intuitive fact. Natural numbers, number of integers, number of fractions all are infinite but are of same size. And using a similar argument, you can establish that number of even numbers is same as number of Natural numbers.\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/qxZmssK.png)\\n\\n*Number of Natural Numbers is same as Number of Even Numbers*\\n\\nThis might tempt you to think that all infinite sets of numbers are of same size, and all we need is to find a one to one correspondence between the sets. But, here is another shocking truth. There are infinities of different types(that is why I chose such title of this blog). \\n\\nReal numbers are set of numbers containing both fractions(rational numbers) and irrational numbers like square root of 2, pi(3.1415...), e(2.718...). You will soon find out that this Real numbers set is larger in size than the Natural numbers set. How will we prove that? Going back to the analogy, if for an unique apple, there is no corresponding orange, then it means the number of apples are larger. In the same manner, suppose we make a list containing correspondence between all Natural Numbers and Real Numbers. If we manage to show that there exists a Real Number, which is not in the list, then it proves that Set of Real Numbers is larger than Set of Natural Numbers.  \\n\\nLet us consider all the Real numbers between 0 and 1. Suppose we enumerate the list of real numbers between 0 and 1. And each real number is given indexed with a corresponding natural number.  Now, can I tell with confidence that the list also contains all the Real Numbers between 0 and 1? Intuitively, seems yes. But, the answer is no. It was Cantor\\'s genius \"diagonal\" argument that he showed that one can find a unique real number, which is not in the list. \\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/ygH0MF1.png)\\n\\n*The list containing all the Real Numbers between 0 and 1 and corresponding Natural Numbers as Index*\\n\\nLet us list all the digits in the diagonal entries, which are marked in bold\\n\\n```\\n1 8 5 1 2...\\n```\\n\\nNow subtract 9 from each digit. Note that each digit obtained after subtracting from 9, will never be the same. The numbers formed will be \\n\\n```\\n8 1 4 8 7...\\n```\\n\\nThe real number between 0 and 1, that can be formed using the above digits will be 0.81487... By design, the new Real number 0.81487... can\\'t occur anywhere in the list. This is because the new real number differs from the 1st real number at first digit, 2nd real number at 2nd digit, it differs from the 5th real number at 5th digit, it differs from nth real number at nth digit. So no matter what list of real numbers you give, using the diagonal argument we can always get a new real number that is not in the list. And that real number will not have a corresponding Natural Number. \\n\\nIf all the Real numbers between 0 and 1 is larger than set of all Natural Numbers, then it is obvious that the complete set of Real Numbers is larger than set of Natural Numbers. Hence it is now apparent that there are 2 types of infinities - The size of Natural Numbers, people called it *Aleph-null* and the other one is size of Real Numbers, which is called *C*. Is the *C* the next immediate number after *Aleph-null*? This is asserted by Continuum hypothesis, which has not yet been solved.\\n\\nThe spirit of this ingenious \"diagonal slash\" argument given by George Cantor is also visible in later ground breaking works - Godel\\'s Incomplete theorem and Turing\\'s Halting Problem. Though such beautiful abstract ideas, may not appear to add any economic value to our daily life, they greatly excite a curious mind and are worth knowing!\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n- Strictly from a mathematician\\'s perspective, numbers starting from zero are called Whole Numbers and numbers starting from one called Natural Numbers.

       " '_posts/2021-05-14-on-notes-from-underground.md': \"---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: I read Notes from Underground\\nsubtitle: \\ndate: 2021-05-14\\ncategories: [books, philosophy, psychology]\\n---\\n\\nI recently read Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky. This is the second book I read of Dostoevsky. Crime and Punishment was my first. This is surprisingly a small around 120 page book, but contains a lot of practical philosophy, which I admit that I couldn't grasp on my own when I read it. YouTube reviews on the book helped me understand things that I missed when I read it first. Nevertheless, there are some good things which I learned from the book. I am not sure if Dostoevsky's intended to tell those, but I will write them down here anyway.\\n\\n## On Dostoevsky\\n\\nI am not a fan of fiction books. I generally read non-fiction. But I really enjoyed reading Crime and Punishment a lot. From then on, I got interested in Dostoevsky, and planned to read more of his works. The best thing I felt about Dostoevsky was that he address more of problems that are practical and mostly due to things happening inside human mind. It is not just circumstances around, but the tenets of Dostoevsky's characters seem to be the main cause of actions. For example, Raskolnikov in C&P commits murder, not mainly because of his poverty but mainly because he believes that he has the moral right to(I concluded this from Raskolnikov's theories on types of people - One like Napoleon and the other like rest. Raskolnikov believed he belonged to the former). Most of the mess, we face is because of how we view things inside our mind. Like Seneca said,\\n\\n*We suffer more often in imagination than reality*\\n\\nAnd I feel Dostoevsky was very well aware of this. I believe that this awareness has come from the suffering that he faced at the Siberian prison camp. It is in suffering that humans come to understand a great deal about reality and themselves. Victor Frankl's work Man's search for Meaning made me think so.\\n\\nI wish to conclude that Dostoevsky's philosophy is more like Psychology of Human mind. In fact, Friedrich Nietzsche popularly said\\n\\n*Dostoevsky,the only psychologist from whom I've anything to learn.* \\n\\nSo, if you are reading abstract philosophy or philosophy that says life is beautiful, people should be happy to live a good life and other straight forward things which only sound good, its time to face a deeper reality, start reading Dostoevsky soon! \\n\\n## On Notes from Underground\\n\\nThe most interesting things I learned from the book were about irrationality and over consciousness(hyperconsciousness is actual word!), and how these 2 things are related. The protagonist in this book is a man, who is over conscious about his actions and intentions, a very rare thing. Most of us, react on our sudden impulses and hardly are aware of what we do and why we do.  So it may seem that this underground man is some philosophically rich guy with a clarity on life and lives a happy life. But that's not the case at all.  \\n\\nHe life is a mess.  He abandons his friends, rudely addresses the girl who came to love this man and is inconsiderate to his servant. The question that arose in my mind was how can someone who can think so deeply face misery. But according to Dostoevsky, it is people who are hyper-aware of themselves end up doing nothing because all they do is think and think but don't act\\n\\n>  But what can one do, if the only straightforward task of every intelligent man is pointless chattering, the deliberate pouring out of emptiness?\\n\\nA normal man, can instead skip all things and proceed to act. If you are overly aware of yourself,  you are more likely to be in dilemma than clarity\\n\\n> Last of all, gentlemen: it is best to do nothing! The best thing is conscious inertia! So long live the underground! Although I have said that I am green with envy of the normal man, I wouldn’t like to be him in the circumstances... \\n\\nRead the second part of the book to completely be get a better clarity on how hyper-consciousness of this underground man messes up things around him. \\n\\nBut does it mean one must act on impulse, rather than reflect on his actions. After all, aren't we superior among all creatures because we have this ability to think about our own thoughts and think about those thoughts further.  I personally believe that [thinking about our actions](https://rakaar.github.io/2021-02-26-stepping-out-of-system/) makes us what we are. One must be aware of what one is doing and why is he/she doing! If not, what better are we from a machine then?\\n\\nMy take away from this book lies not from things I wrote above, but are in the details of the book. The details in thoughts of the underground man. Problems arise because the underground man always considers thinks his actions, with other people's reaction in mind. He does things because he wants to feel superior, he wants to have morally upper hand, he consider himself more intelligent than the rest. Here are some lines from the book which depict that\\n\\nThe following is just a subset of complicated thoughts, just because a officer in tavern moved him by his shoulders without noticing him\\n\\n>  I could have, forgiven him for striking me, but I couldn’t forgive that moving me from place to place without even seeing me.\\n\\n> It was torture to me that even in the street I could not manage to be his equal. ‘Why are you invariably the first to give way?’ I nagged at myself sometimes, hysterical with rage, when I woke up at three o’clock in the morning. ‘Why is it always you, not him? There’s no law about it, is there? nothing on the statute-books?\\n\\n> . ..I composed a really beautiful and charming letter to him, begging him to apologize; I hinted pretty plainly at a duel if he refused. The letter was couched in such terms that if the officer had the slightest understanding of ‘the highest and the best’ he would come running to me at once, fall on my neck and offer me his friendship. And how splendid that would be. We should begin a new life, and what a life! ‘He could protect me with his influential position, and I could develop his better qualities with my culture and… well, my ideas, and all sorts of things could happen!’...\\n\\nWhat sought of guy, takes such things seriously???\\n\\nEven when he meets a beautiful girl at a brothel, and tries to warn her that how her future might be miserable if she continues her job, because he was really moved. And he also, gives her his address so that she could visit him when he had changed his mind. But when she finally do visits him, his false sense of superiority makes him behave rudely towards and ultimately leaves him. In spite of this, the underground man hesitates to apologise.\\n\\n> ...To fall in front of her, burst into repentant sobs, kiss her feet and beg her forgiveness. That was what I wanted; my heart was torn, and never, never, can I remember that moment with indifference.\\n> But – to what end? I thought. Should I not begin to hate her, the very next day, perhaps, precisely because I had kissed her feet today? Could I possibly give her happiness? Had I not recognized my own true value today, for the hundredth time? Could I avoid torturing her?\\n\\nThis echoes the idea of *All problems are interpersonal problems* from the book *Courage to be Disliked*. We suffer in our thoughts mostly because we are concerned about our image in other people's minds.\\n\\n>  When you enter into interpersonal relationships, it is inevitable that to a greater or lesser extent you will get hurt, and you will hurt someone, too. Adler says, “To get rid of one’s problems, all one can do is live in the universe all alone.” But one can’t do such a thing.\\t\\n>\\n> From Courage to be Disliked\\n\",\n",
       " '_posts/2021-09-08-conversation.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Two Friends\\nsubtitle: A hodgepodge of my favourite ideas\\ndate: 2021-09-08\\ncategories: [random]\\n---\\n\\nThere are 2 moods in life. \\n\\n1. Life is short. Don\\'t waste your time being disorganised. Spend your time carefully on things that are meaningful.\\n2. Life is short. You Only Live Once(YOLO). Don\\'t think too much. Just do what you feel is the most exciting thing at the present, no matter what it is.\\n\\nYou can suggest that one can plan meticulously and divide one\\'s time for both the moods. But an overlap is inevitable. When you start doing things that seem most exciting at present, you loose track of time and the mood doesn\\'t let you stop. For example, watching an exciting movie or reading an exciting book at night takes away time, you know you have to stop doing it so that you wake up early and do other \"productive\" things. But the YOLO mood doesn\\'t let you do that. In this blog, I try to explore both the moods via a conversation between 2 friends.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong. I have no interest in the questions - What is the meaning of life? , Why do we exist? I believe that questioning the purpose of existence takes away its beauty. But I also believe that on properly reflecting on one\\'s actions and plans provides a feedback, which helps to change one\\'s actions that might make you more happy. \\n\\n(While having a walk, **R** comes across his friend **K**)\\n\\n**R**: Common, let\\'s get to have some Pizza! \\n\\n**K**: Even I feel like having a Pizza badly from a week. But not today! Have some work to be done tonight.\\n\\n**R**: What has Pizza got to do with it? Eat now and work at night.\\n\\n**K**: But eating Pizza sedates me and I won\\'t be able to stay mentally active to think.\\n\\n**R**: I get you. But why do you complicate Life so much? Its just a goddam Pizza. If you like having one, you have it. You don\\'t think much. Its that simple.\\n\\n**K**: So, don\\'t you think that would lead to waste of time in Life if you surrender to such instant gratifications. And don\\'t you think that it is a meaningless way to spend life?\\n\\n**R**: I never thought you would bring up \"meaning of life\" for a pizza? \\n\\n**K**: You started it.\\n\\n**R**: See, here is what I view life as. You are well aware that your exist due to *cumulative evolution of non-random survival of random hereditary changes*. It is just that we are more complicated than other species, but we are no different. You and I are just living creatures, like that dog there, and this mosquito swirling around my ear(*swats the mosquito*). There is no difference except in size. And it is just due to time and evolution, we just have complex desires. So, if I feel like having a pizza, I should just have it. There is nothing to think about. \\n\\n**K**: But do you really see no difference between you and a mosquito, that just squatted?\\n\\n**R**: No difference, except that it doesn\\'t want a pizza like me, and it has its own desires. May be my blood is the pizza equivalent for a mosquito.\\n\\n**K**: So, would you be comfortable in killing a dog as much as you were comfortable in killing a mosquito?\\n\\n**R**: Are you mad? No, of course. Why will I kill a dog?\\n\\n**K**: Then why did you kill that mosquito. Because you implicitly believe that a mosquito is less \"living\" than you are, less living than a \"dog\". It is because of its *small sized soul*. You don\\'t believe that the mosquito perceives the life as you do. If you really believed so, you wouldn\\'t squat the mosquito. Its pure hypocrisy.\\n\\n**R**: So, you are now calling me hypocrite? You know what, you are a bigger hypocrite than I am. You speak all this \"meaningful way of spending life\" and all you do is abstract mathematics and physics, that practically adds no value. At least my research in Public Policy helps in shaping the society better. What has your 11 dimensions in String Theory got to do with real 3 dimensional world?\\n\\n**K**: I don\\'t care if the equations have any practical utility. I do theoretical physics to understand the beautiful nature around me. I am a product of nature, and I feel studying the details of her makes life meaningful. I don\\'t care if the theoretical ideas add any economic value. Though, I could have given enough examples of instances where theoretical physics provides economic value, I wanted to tell the reason why I do theoretical physics. \\n\\n**R**: Ok, if doing things that satisfy you is the main purpose of your life instead of caring about meaning then why don\\'t you come to have the pizza.\\n\\n**K**: You are confusing value with meaning. I said, I find meaning in theoretical physics, though it doesn\\'t add any value.\\n\\n**R**: Is it not a selfish way to live life? To live a life, where you are concerned only about what you want to do, ignoring completely what you can contribute. You are able to live a advanced comfortable life; don\\'t you feel owed to contributions by other humans of the past and present? Don\\'t you feel compelled to contribute something of *real value* to humanity. Where is now the meaning if you forget all that and live only as per your desires?\\n\\n**K**: Your words won\\'t change my opinion.  \\n\\n**R**: But your words can change my opinion. \\n\\n**K**: See, I do understand that abstract physics adds no economic value. But you know, we humans have a beautiful and complicated mind that is capable of doing activities, that no other creature is capable of. So, I do all these sorts of activities because I have a brain that is capable of handling such complexity, I do understand that it doesn\\'t increase any survival prospects. But I want to do it because I am capable of doing it!\\n\\n**R**: At this point, I am convinced that you are spoiled by random useless philosophies. Abstract mathematics and Philosophy make up a perfect poison mixture, which kills a beautiful perception of life. You are like the kid Kolya from The Brothers Karamazov. But like Alyosha, I do love you and hope that you realise things as you grow. \\n\\nI don\\'t have a complicated perception of life as yours. You have been giving up instant gratifications for sake of living a meaningful life, which you believe makes you happy. So suppose, on your way to home you meet with an accident and die. What happened to your desires which you postponed for the future? Now, you can\\'t have any of the good things that you delayed and planned to have them later in life. And this can happen, there is no guarantee to life. And in fact life is too short, the only way to live a meaningful life is too *actively seek out for things that want*. You should do it if you want it because you never know if you\\'ll later have a chance.\\n\\n**K**: I have read the Paul Graham\\'s article *Life is too short* that you are trying to quote. But if I die on my way, I will die happily that I died trying to do what I wanted to. I will have no regrets! And ya, I love you too, though I disagree a lot with you.\\n\\n**R**: Aah, its a waste of time to argue further. I am going to have my pizza!\\n\\n(*Both part their ways*)\\n\\n## Inspiration for a Conversation\\n\\nI love Hofstadter\\'s writing style. And I am convinced that his style is one of a kind. In his book Godel Escher Bach, each chapter is preceded by a conversation between characters mostly involving Tortoise and Achilles(sometimes a crab also creeps in. Hofstadter took these characters from Lewis Caroll\\'s book *What the Tortoise said to Achilles)*. In the conversation, Hofstadter tries to explore the concepts of upcoming chapter in an indirect way. In preface of \"I am a Strange Loop\", Hofstadter writes that while he was presenting his ideas, he had fallen into a conversation between him and a hypothetical sceptical reader. So he took a pair of characters and explored the idea via a conversation.\\n\\nThe book *Courage to be disliked*, express the ideas of Adlerian Psychology through a conversation between a young man and a philosopher. The purpose of including the conversation was similar to Hofstadter\\'s. The ideas of Adlerian Psychology are counter-intuitive. A direct introduction of such ideas would give rise to number of objections and questions in a reader\\'s mind. So, the book explores the ideas via a conversation where the student plays the role of a sceptical reader. \\n\\nConversation styled writing seem to be an effective way to introduce new ideas, which have an immediate tendency to be opposed.\\n\\n## References\\n\\nThe conversation was a hodgepodge of some of my favourite ideas, which are *tatooed on my neurons*. Here is the list of references(The phrase *tatooed on neurons* was taken from a [Scott Hughes\\'s lecture](https://youtu.be/TiHHz3sKDbY?t=4259))\\n\\n- The words *cumulative evolution of non-random survival of random hereditary changes* was taken from Dawkin\\'s essay - *Darwinian Triumphant* from the book *A Devil\\'s Chaplain*.\\n\\n- *Small Sized souls*, the idea that mosquitoes are not self aware as we are, the idea that people squat mosquito because they implicitly believe mosquitoes are not as \"living\" as other creatures are taken from I am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter.\\n\\n- One should do such complicated things, because of the capabilities our mind has was taken from a video of Dawkins titled [The importance of doing useless things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWRumo75pgc).\\n\\n- **Context of Kolya**: In the book *The Brothers Karamazov* by Dostoevsky, Kolya is a 13 year old kid, who is intelligent and far more matured than any child of his age. At an early age Kolya gets exposed to many philosophical ideas and starts believing in Socialism, Atheism and has a radical view on many things in life. Alyosha thinks that Kolya has been spoiled by reading philosophies at a tender age, which are beyond his understanding and believes in them blindly due to lack of maturity. But Alyosha admires Kolya\\'s intelligence and treats him as an equal and loves him as a friend. Alyosha believes that he will get a better understanding of world, when he grows up. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dostoevsky/comments/o8xoiz/on_kolya_krassotkin/) is a great monologue on Kolya\\'s character.\\n\\n- The words *one should actively seek out things that matter* is taken from Paul Graham\\'s essay - [Life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)\\n\\n- Though the gender of both the friends is not mentioned, they tell each other \"I love you\". I deliberately put this to talk about the kind of love that doesn\\'t have to be romantic(I admit that I did it poorly). The word love is mostly used in 2 cases - romantic relationship, a family relationship like Mother\\'s love for her son, brother\\'s love for his sister. The idea of using the word *love* between 2 friends may seem strange, but it cannot be wrong if the friendship arouses the  beautiful feeling akin to one caused by romantic relationship. I got introduced to this idea in one of the essays of Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green, where John writes \\n\\n> *We[John and his friend] were not afraid to say “I love you” to each other.* \\n\\nThere are couple of videos of John on the same topic - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixr4YISTmck), [2](https://youtu.be/DHSA_IJs7QY).  John also started the culture of [Esther day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Earl#Esther_Day) in the memory of Esther Earl, who suggest him the idea of celebrating such kinds of love.\\n\\n- The idea of not delaying good things because you never know when you will die was a revelation after I had an [accident](https://imgur.com/kFSwWk8)(Luckily, everyone was safe!).\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n> You are able to live a advanced comfortable life; don\\'t you feel owed to contributions by other humans of the past and present? Don\\'t you feel compelled to contribute something of *real value* to humanity. Where is now the meaning if you forget all that and live only as per your desires?\\n\\nIf you look back at history, most of the great theories and discoveries were made because people working on it were obsessed with the problem. They didn\\'t care if the problem had any economic value. It is sometimes years later that the abstract theories find their practical usage. For example, number theory which was believed to be an abstract field later played a key role in development of cryptography, which is now undeniably important for a secure internet. Similarly, non-Euclidean geometry developed by Riemann, Gauss,  Lobachevsky and Bolyai was used in developing a theory of Gravity(General Relativity) by Einstein, which is now used in GPS. I guess that\\'s why it is advised to work on problems that you are excited about, without being bothered by other things. [This Feynman\\'s letter](https://fs.blog/2014/08/richard-feynman-what-problems-to-solve/) explains it well.\\n\\nBut I didn\\'t write all this, as I felt that would divert the theme of the conversation. I was interested in exploring the personal reasons than historical.\\n',\n",
       " '_posts/2021-09-27-my-anthro-review.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle:  My Version of Anthropocene Reviewed\\nsubtitle: A literary experiment\\ndate:   2021-09-27\\ncategories: [random]\\n---\\n\\nAnthropocene Reviewed is a book by John Green, which is a collection of essays *reviewing different facets of human-centered planet on a five-star scale*. What I loved most about the book was that in each topic, John speaks about the human side of things. It was a unexpressible kind of pleasure my neurons felt while reading the essays. So, I wondered how it would be to think and express about the things I love in this human-centered planet and ventured to write the below.\\n\\n## Reddit\\n\\nThe reason I love reddit more than any most other social media is that its not user-based like many other platforms rather it is community based. In other platforms, people post mostly about themselves, the content is mostly based on their own life. But in Reddit, people post about things of their interest. Each sub-reddit is like a community that shares a common passion. This quote perfectly describes it\\n\\n> If Facebook is people you know sharing things you don’t care about, Reddit is things you care about shared by people you don’t know.\\n>\\n> -Tim Squirrel, PhD\\n\\nWhat makes Reddit more interesting is its anonymity. Very few individuals(like me) put their actual names as Reddit username. This anonymity gives a great liberation to speak openly about things they love or hate. Despite the anonymity, the community has a strong bonding. People love and hate the same thing. For example, the whole of reddit loves Keanu Reaves, hates TikTok for reasons even they individually are not aware of. There was a meme which aptly put it - *The only reason you hate TikTok is because Reddit told you to*. \\n\\nLike all young, hot-blooded, amateur thinkers, I have my own theories. Here is one of those. I think that for a strong bond to form between people there is a need of either of these - sharing of common pain or sharing a common madness. On Reddit, you will find subreddits(communities) based on both. \\n\\nOne of my favourite stories is the Gamestop story . When the subreddit `r/wallstreetbets`  figured out that the giant corporations were trying to manipulate the stock prices, they decided to fight back. They made a co-ordinated attack to manipulate the prices. Whats extraordinary about this story, is that the redditors didn\\'t even knew each other, but together they had enough strength to manipulate the global economic system. The people were sharing the same pain - the pain that giant corporations made profit in stock market using their influence. \\n\\nReddit confuses me and also amazes me. I thought people would only share their interests and there was no place for personal things. But I am surprised to find subreddits like `r/madeMeSmile` where people share their personal wholesome moments. A lady sharing her preganancy news, an elder deciding to restart college, a teenage kid who got liberated from cancer. These are moments, which involve intense emotions and yet people happily share it with a bunch of strangers whom they don\\'t even know in person and will possibly never know in their entire life. \\n\\nMay be there is a joy in sharing what you love, sharing what you are excited and happy about. Carl Sagan said *When you are in love, you want to tell it to the world*. He made this statement to explain why he popularises science. But I think this is also true in general. Human soul is too small to handle such intense emotions - both joy and agony. You don\\'t have to know the person, but you know what they feel. We humans have a lot in common, which we take for granted.\\n\\nHere is my my another favourite story from Reddit. In the subreddit `r/roastme`, people post their pics and ask the subreddit to roast them. Once a 17 year old kid, shared his picture asking the people to roast to have a reason to end it all. From the post caption and boy\\'s dulls eyes, one would surely suspect that he was planning to commit suicide. But the subreddit chose not to roast. They saw and felt the pain in the boy\\'s eyes. The comments were filled with words giving hope, comfort and courage. Here is one of them\\n\\n> I won\\'t roast you, but I will wrap you in a blanket and make you a burrito. Then I\\'ll give you tea. It\\'s difficult to be depressed when you\\'re a warm burrito. I\\'ve been down that road before, and I just want you to know you have something to live for. Get well, man\\n\\nIt is really amazing that online communities, which were intended to share things of common interest in their free time have potential to impact lives, alter global economic system.\\n\\nI give Reddit four and a half stars.\\n\\n## Recommendation Algorithms\\n\\nFew months back, I was recommended a YouTube video of a beautiful lady delivering her MBA commencement speech. I am thankful to YouTube for recommending it. Habitually I went straight to the comments. I was impressed that there were many people like me, who were recommended this video. But among the comments, one particular comment caught my attention, which said \\n\\n>  *YouTube Algorithm knows me better than my family*.\\n\\nThough that was put as a joke, I felt there was some truth in it. On many days, most of my times goes on YouTube rather than spending with people. So, its not an understatement to say that the algorithm knows me well.\\n\\nYouTube recommendations helped me discover many cool things on earth. I was introduced to the Socialist Philosopher Slavoj Zizek. And I can\\'t thank YouTube enough for it. Later I learnt that I was not alone. In some of the comments of Zizek\\'s videos, I found people telling that they too were being recommended Zizek videos by the algorithm. As it went on, I was impressed by the recommendations and the feeling that algorithms know me well grew stronger.\\n\\nLater I thought that YouTube is recommending the same videos for almost everyone who spend a lot of time on YouTube. There are certain things that attract a large audience irrespective of their background like physical attractiveness, humour. And Zizek is a popular for his humour. May be YouTube algorithm is smart enough to figure out such common things and recommend related videos.\\n\\nI always thought human emotions were special. Special in the sense that replicating human emotions in a machine was never considered a serious problem. With my experience of YouTube algorithms, I feel that though a machine can\\'t have emotions on its own, it can well understand human emotions better than humans. This reminds me of an episode from the show Silicon Valley where Jared spends 12 hours beside the pool, conversing with a robot. Later Jared expresses that talking to the bot makes him feel energetic despite the lack of sleep.\\n\\nWhen in distress, I long to talk to people. And talking to people is a beautiful thing. The casual talk has the tendency to remind yourself that probably life is not too rough as you think. But now, I just open YouTube. Its faster to open a site than ask a friend to talk. I know that the effect of a talk is no near to the surfing random videos. But somehow, watching the random videos and reading comments make you realise that you are not the one facing the same problem. This gives a great comfort. \\n\\nOnce when I didn\\'t feel like doing my homework and was frustated that I wasn\\'t doing it, I went to YouTube to seek comfort and found this comment in one of the videos\\n\\n> Watching a smart guy do smart things and talk about smart things without doing my homework is a mood\\n\\n(I was precisely doing it. The comment has 52 thousand likes, at the time of writing this sentence)\\n\\nThere are many other comments, which somehow magically describe the situation you are in so aptly without even knowing about your life. I know in times of stress, the most appropriate thing to do is to express the problem to a fellow human being so that he/she understands you and may share the burden. But that\\'s a time taking process! YouTube Recommendations do it for me. Its like a friend who knows what I like. \\n\\nAs I keep spending my time on the platform, the algorithm starts knowing me better, my secret desires, my interests, what goes through in life; it knows me better than my family. Though it can never understand what I go through as a human, it knows me well and tries to make me happy.\\n\\nI know I have potrayed Recommendation Algorithms here as a kind mysterious friend, as opposed to the popular opinion that Recommendation Algorithms are villains created by giant corporations that want us hooked with the product for their own profit. But there is a reason why distressed people binge random videos on YouTube. This is magical that we are in age, where human interests are better known by machines than fellow human beings.\\n\\nI give Recommendation Algorithms four and a half stars.\\n\\n## Gravitational Waves\\n\\nWhenever a scientist proposes a new theory, it changes our understanding of the nature. We have a model which gives us an idea of how Nature might work. Each theory has its own contribution. But some theories completely shatter our intuition about the world. With no doubt, Special Relativity, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are among the list.\\n\\nSpecial theory of relativity gives us a new picture that time is not absolute and it depends on the speed with which people are moving. The twin paradox, though a hackneyed example, explains the idea well. One of the two twins leaves the earth and travels in space with a speed comparable to speed of light. On his return, the space traveller is now younger than his twin brother because time dilates for the traveller who has travelled with high speed. This can happen in reality. But it is called a paradox because of its counter-intuitiveness. Calling it a \"veridical paraodox\" would be more appropriate.\\n\\nWhat fascinates me about Relativity is the story behind it. Einstein was a patent clerk when he proposed his theory. He got the job with the support of Marcel Grossmann, a friend who also helped Einstein during his college years by providing his notes. In fact, the job description was tailored so that it can be given to Einstein. And Einstein used to work on his ideas while in the office. In fact that year 1905, along with Special Relativity, Einstein proposed 4 other papers that shook the foundations of physics. The papers included photoelectric effect that fetched him Nobel Prize and the popular Energy and mass equivalence relation(E = MC^2). In the fact the popular equation was a follow up to the Special Relativity paper. \\n\\nOne of the main hypothesis that leads to Special Relativity is that speed of light is constant for any observer no matter what. This was proved by Michelson-Morley experiment. What blows my mind more is that Einstein was not aware of this experiment while writing the Special Relativity paper. He hypothesised it purely on theoretical basis. What a genius!\\n\\nThe guy didn\\'t stop there, Special Relativity worked for cases only when observers don\\'t accelerate, a special case(hence the name Special Relativity). So, after 10 years, Albert came up with one of the most important theories - General Relativity(GR). The theory gives us a new picture of what gravity is.\\n\\nNewton just proposed that all objects attracted each other and gave a mathematical model for it. But he could never explain the cause. Einstein\\'s GR explains the cause and it gives us a complete new picture. Instead of Gravity being some mysterious force, it is something that occurs out of Geometry. I personally don\\'t know enough to explain it well. There is a lot of dirty mathematics that goes on behind. This quote by John Wheeler summarises General Relativity is\\n\\n*Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve*\\n\\nA popular example is explained using the trampoline. The trampoline is assumed as fabric of space-time. When a heavy object like a bowling ball is placed, its bends the trampoline. Now when you throw marbles with some initial velocity, they revolve around to bowling ball and finally fall in the center. This setup is similar to Sun at the center and planets revolving around it except that planets don\\'t ultimately fall into the sun. But this setup attempts to explain that just due to sheer presence of mass, the fabric of space-time is bent, which further causes the matter to move.\\n\\nSo, just like when there are ripples in the cloth of the trampoline when disturbed, Einstein proposed that there would also be waves in fabric of space-time which could be propagated. These are called Gravitational waves. Just like the ripples in the pond, Gravitational waves travel when there is a disturbance in space time. But for such a distrubance, we need massively large bodies. Collision of two massive stars or Black holes are perfect candidates for that.\\n\\nGravitational waves are not just a theoretical statement. They have been detected in 2015, a century after Einstein proposed his paper of Gravitational waves. And detecting Gravitational waves was not a small task. Even a massive collision between 2 large black holes that far away would change the space less than a width of a proton. So to detect such a small change, one needs an ultra sensitive instrument. They built 2 large L shaped structures at 2 places - Hanford and Livingston.\\n\\nWhat fascinates me about Gravitational waves is that it is a new window to look into the world. To observe the universe, the only media we had was - light and neutrinos(high energy subatomic particles released from massive sources far from our galaxy). You can\\'t hear sounds in space as there no medium. But now we have Gravity as a messenger of events happening far out their in the universe. This fascinates me because man has discovered ways to understand universe in a far complex way anyone could have imagined - Ripples in spacetime as ripples in pond, that\\'s an amazing idea right. \\n\\nAnd gravitational waves, were not something that humans came across by chance like in the case of Cosmic Microwave Radiation(Though Cosmic Microwaves were also predicted before  theoretically). Gravitational waves were first perceived by human intellect. It is after 100 years that humans could detect them with ingenious experiment design. This is what I think is one of the exciting things in Theoretical Physics. The field involves a lot of Abstract math and dirty markings on papers and yet the end of the day with these dirty marks you discover some of the deepest secrets of the universe. Secrets, that can never be perceived by regular sensory perceptions. \\n\\nHere is another thing that blows my mind. General Relativity was proposed in 1915, and was verified in 1919. A new state of matter called Bose Einstein Condensate was theorised in the year 1925, and it was in 1995 that we could make Bose Einstein Condensate in a laboratory. The fact that black holes appear inevitably was theorised in 1960s and the first image of Black hole was capture in 2017. Look at the gap between when the idea was perceived and when it was physically realised. Doesn\\'t that fascinate you the humans can figure out the secrets of the universe with a pencil and paper. When Einstein was shown his new office in Institute of Advanced Study, he was asked what equipment he might need, he replied *“A desk or table, a chair, paper and pencils. Oh yes, and a large wastebasket, so I can throw away all my mistakes.”*\\n\\nWe should also take a moment to appreciate the efforts at individual level. Back in the days, when many didn\\'t believe in Gravitational waves. Three men - Kip Throne, Rainer Weiss, Ron Drever proposed to build a large detector that could detect Gravitational waves. Kip being the theoretical guy; Rai and Ron being the experimentalists. This is different from Large Hadron Colliders(a long tunnel built underground where sub atomic particles are made to collide), where the experiments are controlled by humans. But for a Gravitational wave detector to detect something there has to be a collision event between 2 massive bodies. And in those days, many didn\\'t even believe that Black holes were true. But these men believed enough in their ideas and experiment design to convince such a large scale project. To fund such a large scale project, would require millions of dollars. Convincing the organisations like NSF and government to support such a venture was no easy deal. The efforts are brilliantly explained in the book Black hole blues by Janna Levin.\\n\\nThe Advanced Observatory was completely setup in 2014. And the first detection was done in Sept 14, 2014. The collision between super massive black holes happened million years ago. And we just completed setting up our instruments months before we could detect it. What a timing! *Fortune indeed favours the brave*.\\n\\nPhysicists are still looking out for a new theory of Gravity, they call it quantum gravity. Their aim is to merge both the greatest theories - Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. There are lot of secrets that are yet to be uncovered by pencil marks on papers.\\n\\nI give Gravitational waves five stars.\\n\\n## Free will\\n\\nHuman brain is complex enough to perceive about itself(be conscious). According to Hofstadter, other small sized creatures like mosquito, bees, insects don\\'t have this quality. In the book *I am a Strange Loop*, he calls such creatures as *small sized souls*. Small sized souls don\\'t have the ability to perceive themselves. Hofstadter writes *other small sized creatures don\\'t enjoy this luxury of self-representation*. But is it a luxury?\\n\\nIs being able to perceive ourselves a special evolutionary gift to humans? Would we have been better off, if we were as simple as other creatures? Now that all of this happened due to evolution, you can\\'t undo it. At times I feel the being conscious is a burden, and complicates the simple and  beautiful life. But then I realise I couldn\\'t perceive life as simple and beautiful, if I were not conscious. \\n\\nThere was a statement in the famous Grand Inquisitor story from the The Brothers Karamazov - *Not all men can handle the burden of conscience*. In the story, when God visits the earth, the Grand Inquisitor(consider him as a representative of religious authority) complains to God in a monologue, that God had done wrong in giving humans the freedom of choice. Not all men can bear that. Increasing man\\'s freedom *has burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with sufferings forever*. The Grand Inquisitor says that the Religious authorities are here to undo God\\'s mistakes. By submitting to the authority and following blindly, people can get rid of the burden of freedom of choice. \\n\\nAre humans really too intelligent to handle themselves? Is giving away our freedom of choice a way of living a happy life? Many of us think that we do make most of the decisions individually. But on reflection, it doesn\\'t seem so. The system is so complicated that forces beyond our control make us do things. It is an illusion because its seems at the lowest level you are the sole maker of decisions. But on a higher level, the things that you are asked to do are not really your choice. Like a student can decide what to wear, what to eat, when to wake up but the choice of him going to college or not is not optional. The student has to do it, because he is asked by his parents or he wants the position of respected individual in a society. \\n\\nThere is another argument at physical level on the issue of free will. Our brain at the end of the day, is a matter consisting of particles behaving as per laws of physics. So, what is difference between a rock rolling down the hill as per physics laws and particles inside our cranium except the level of complexity? Do we really have free will?\\n\\nAmong the above two questions - free will at social level and free will at physical level, the former troubles me more. Because the latter seems to be more of an objective fact which cannot be changed. I feel that most of the times we don\\'t want the freedom to make decisions in bigger aspects of life, which are connected to our living. The freedom of choice is a burden, because you will have to be responsible for your own choices and actions. If things go wrong, you will have to face the consequences, and its a new road and no one is there to show you the path. \\n\\nBut where would you like to go? An unfamiliar wild path or a familiar garden? Here I get reminded of Nietzsche\\'s words - *The secret to a joyful life is to live dangerously*.\\n\\n> For believe me! — the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is: to live dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships into uncharted seas! Live at war with your peers and yourselves! Be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors, you seekers of knowledge! Soon the age will be past when you could be content to live hidden in forests like shy deer! At long last the search for knowledge will reach out for its due: — it will want to rule and possess, and you with it!\\n\\n So may be freedom of choice is a burden worth bearing.\\n\\nNow lets come to physical level. Do humans really have free will or are we bound to physical laws. People who believe that we have free will propose that there is something non-physical aspect in each human, which causes this free will. This non-physical aspects of any theory infuriates scientists and philosophers, who strongly believe in physical nature of the universe. Among them, there is one man - Douglas Hofstadter, whose views and ideas are convincing to anyone who loves strong reasoning.\\n\\nAccording to Hofstadter, consciousness is something that arises out of physical complexity. I believe in the latter. To quote him, *consciousness is not a Power Moonroof*.  The fact that we are just a large collection of physical particles following certain laws is extremely disturbing. If someone convinces you that what you perceive as \"I\" is just an illusion that arises out of inanimate process and it is strongly a part of you because it is a helpful abstract concept for survival, it initially shatters your ideas of human life being a special and gifted. But this also amazing when you realise the level of complexity within you that helps you perceive this \"I\". \\n\\nSo, I guess Free will at both the levels is an illusion.\\n\\nI give free will three stars.\\n\\n## 7G Brundavan Colony\\n\\n7G Brundavan Colony is a telugu dubbed version of the Tamil movie 7G Rainbow colony. The movie is popular for many comedy scenes. But there is one particular scene in the movie, which I feel is one of the iconic scenes. Let me tell you the scene. But first I need to set the context.\\n\\nOur hero is a young carefree college student. He doesn\\'t go to college regularly, spends his time with friends doing unproductive stuff, always gets beaten up by his father for being that way. (There is a popular meme based on the scene where the father beats him). A young lady, who happens to be the heroine newly moves to the colony, where our hero resides. Heroine is concerned about hero\\'s carefree attitude. She wants him to be responsible. She enquires hero\\'s friends if he is good at anything and gets to know that hero can assemble a bike from different stolen parts.\\n\\nHeroine goes to  a popular company \"Hero Honda\" and tells her acquaintance who works over there about hero\\'s skill and asks him if he can be given any job. Hero is asked to demonstrate his skills. He first hesitates to do it. Heroine drags hero to the bathroom and slaps him and proposes her love. Ultimately, our enlightened hero proves his skill and gets the job. As per heroine\\'s words, hero goes to inform his father about the job.\\n\\nNow the scene!\\n\\nHero shows the offer letter to his father and tells him that he has got a job at Hero Honda. Hero\\'s father glances at the letter and asks if its a mechanic job to which his son confirms by nodding his head. The father then asks, \"So, no need to study anymore?\". Hero again nods his head saying yes.\\n\\nHero\\'s father in a disappointing voice says, \"If you have told this previously, we wouldn\\'t have wasted the damn money on your college. We thought you would study hard and get a great job. But finally, you made a fool out of me\" and throws the letter down.\\n\\nYou can see a overwhelming mixture of sadness and anger on hero\\'s face due to his father\\'s reaction. Hero is sad that his father still doesn\\'t recognise him, and also angry that his father is still treating the same way he did all these years.\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s silence, hero\\'s father angrily continues, \"All these years, there is nothing much you have told. What is there to tell now? Go\"\\n\\nHero stands there with his eyes expressing the same emotion. Hero\\'s father in the same angry tone, \"Still why are you standing like a statue! Go!\"  Having no choice hero goes to his room.\\n\\nBut that night, while on bed before going to sleep we see the father rubbing the offer letter smoothly with his fingers out of love. His wife, who is beside him asks \"Is it a good job\". He replies proudly \"If not then. Do you have any idea how many people are struggling to get into this company?\". He asks if his son has slept. She tells him that he has slept without even having his dinner and asks that he should have been more nice to his son.\\n\\nThe father says, \"All these years, I have beat him and scolded him. And now when he comes up with a job and if I suddenly praise him, he might think that I loved him only for money\" and sobs heavily.\\n\\nAnd he continues, \"To all those people who said, what good is your son for. I will show this letter and tell them proudly that my son works at Hero Honda. I knew that he would become this great one day\" and the conversation between husband and wife continues.\\n\\nAnd in the next room, we are shown hero who overheard the conversation cries, closing his mouth to not let his cries be heard. This was the amount of love that he hadn\\'t even expected in his dreams.\\n\\nThe thing that\\'s most evident superficial is a father\\'s love towards his son. But what\\'s more fascinating is that the scene depicts a kind of love that\\'s pure. Pure in the sense, that it doesn\\'t depend on anything related to the person except the person itself. The father will love his son, no matter what how unproductive he is.\\n\\nWe unconsciously sometimes admire a person more because of some temporary things like social status or place they work. But I think it is important to realise that such attributes of a person are temporary, and true love lies in loving the person as he/she naturally is. \\n\\nAnother theme which is elusive is the reluctance of expressing love. In a family, people don\\'t express their love openly. May be is it because it is implicit and need not be told. But in this scene, we see that father has to behave completely opposite to what he feels. And you see that neither father nor hero exchange any words in the next day morning. The son who has overheard the conversation doesn\\'t speak a word. The father who is proud doesn\\'t tell the truth why he acted to be angry. The truth is clear to both, yet still they hesitate to exchange words. May be words are weak enough to express their love. But we also see how can love be conveyed without a direct exchange between the two people. \\n\\nMay be, there is no need to express love when there is enough of it. \\n\\nI give 7G Brundavan Colony five stars.\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n- **7G Brundavan Colony**: If you want to watch the scene, watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeHgipE4WZM) from 2:37. You don\\'t have to understand telugu, the expression in the actors\\' eyes convey the emotion!\\n- **Free will**: I understand that I have talked about quiet differently than the actual notion of free will. The idea that freedom of choice is a burden for many stuck me, when I first read the Grand Inquisitor Story. Hence I wanted to explore more about the idea by writing.\\n- **Gravitational Waves**: The gap between theoretical prediction and experimental verification in physics has always been fascinating for me. So, I took Gravitational waves as a topic, to talk about it. The fact that we can figure out details of a collision between two blackholes that happened millions of years ago via ripples in fabric of Space-time blows my mind.\\n- **Recommendation Algorithms:** When I was disturbed about something, I used to(I still now but seldom) binge random YouTube recommended videos. I thought it was only me who does that. But later I found this to be a common thing. This kind of distraction is unique in the sense that you are consuming content that is not chosen by you, unlike watching movies or listening songs. So, I tried to explore it by looking at another side. I first encountered this idea in a [Jack Dorsey interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpefkBGbdJg), where Jack quoting  Yuval Noah Harari\\'s 21 lessons book says that for kids being grown today, Google has a stronger sense of their preferences than they do. He adds that for someone who grew up in the age of internet, their self awareness is being offloaded to other systems and algorithms. It was a disturbing truth to me that in our era machines understand humans better than fellow human beings. So I wanted to explore the idea more by writing about it. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kyvYhbM24E) is clip from Silicon Valley that I was talking about.\\n- **Reddit**: Anyone who has spent a month exploring Reddit, will surely be amused by its unique nature. Its not like any other social media out there. The experience and environment are completely different. So, I wrote a part of wholesome things I feel about Reddit.\\n',\n",

       " '_posts/2020-04-07-understanding-endorsement-policies-in-HF.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle:  Understanding Endorsement Policies in Hyperledger Fabric\\nsubtitle: \\ndate:   2020-04-07\\ncategories: [blockchain]\\n---\\n\\n### Introduction\\nEndorsement Policy defines which peers should execute a transaction and endorse its result(signing the execution result with its certificates) \\nso as to consider the transaction to be valid. In other words, only after a set of peers endorse a transaction\\'s result then only\\nthe transaction will be committed in the ledger. *This is my attempt to learn aspects of endorsement policy with more clarity*\\n\\n### Where is it defined\\nWell, endorsement policies can be defined at three different levels\\n- Chaincode Level\\n- Collection Level\\n- Key Level\\n\\n### Syntax\\nThe Endorsement policies is expressed in terms of `MSP_ID.ROLE`(also known as *principal*). The sytax for\\na endorsement policy is `EXPR(E[, E...]`\\nSome Examples are:-\\n- `AND(\\'Org1.member\\', \\'Org2.member\\', \\'Org3.member\\')` or `OutOf(3, \\'Org1.member\\', \\'Org2.member\\', \\'Org3.member\\')`\\nMeans signature is required from all the three principals\\n- `OR(\\'Org1.member\\', \\'Org2.member\\')` or `OutOf(1, \\'Org1.member\\', \\'Org2.member\\')`\\nMeans signature is requried from either of the principals\\n\\n### Endorsement Policy at Chaincode Level\\nEndorsement policies defined at chaincode level is agreed at the time of approval\\nof the chaincode definition. By default, this needs to be approved by majority \\nof he channel members. Now the question is how do you define this ? There are 2 ways\\n- Use Fabric SDK APIs\\n- Use CLI using `â€”-signature-policy` while committing the chaincode\\n\\nIf none of the above is done, then by default endorsement policy would be \\nthat majority of channel members need to endorse.\\n\\n### What are Private data Collection\\nSuppose within a channel, you want a transaction to occur, which must be known \\nto only a few members of the channel. One way of achieving it would be to create a\\nfurthur channel, but that would cause excess burden of maintaining chaincode, MSPs etc.\\nPrivate data Collection is the solution for exchanging private data within a channel.\\nHere only the members defined in the *collection* would store data in a private DB also called \\nas *side DB*. Also every peer stores the hash of the data in its ledger. Note that the data\\npasses from one member to other without the ordering service. Even the ordering services get \\nthe hash of the data. Hence private data collections can be used when you want to keep the\\ndata confidential from the ordering services. Also, forgot to mention another feature, it also allows\\na part of the transactional data to be confidential from few members of the channel.\\n\\n### Endorsement Policy at Collection Level\\nEndorsement Policy at Collection Level can be defined at the place where collections are defined,which is generally in a JSON file. And example would look something like this(example taken from HF docs):\\n```\\n{\\n    \"name\": \"collectionMarblePrivateDetails\",\\n    \"policy\": \"OR(\\'Org1MSP.member\\')\",\\n    \"requiredPeerCount\": 0,\\n    \"maxPeerCount\": 3,\\n    \"blockToLive\":3,\\n    \"memberOnlyRead\": true,\\n    \"memberOnlyWrite\":true,\\n    \"endorsementPolicy\": {\\n      \"signaturePolicy\": \"OR(\\'Org1MSP.member\\')\"\\n    }\\n }\\n```\\nThe last key is the endorsement policy defined for the private data collection named \"collectionMarblePrivateDetails\". Do not confuse the first key \\'policy\\' with endorsement policy. The value of the key \\'policy\\' defines defines which organizations peers are allowed to persist the collection data. This  collection level endorsement policy can be utlized to override the chaincode level endorsement policy.\\n\\n### Endorsement Policy at Key Level\\nEndorsement Policies at Key Level can be defined from within the chaincode. For example, the Go Shim API provides basic functions like `SetStateValidationParameter(key string, ep []byte) error`, `GetStateValidationParameter(key string) ([]byte, error)`, `SetPrivateDataValidationParameter(collection, key string, ep []byte) error`, `GetPrivateDataValidationParameter(collection, key string) ([]byte, error)`.\\nThere are also extension provided by the API like\\n```\\ntype KeyEndorsementPolicy interface {\\n    // Policy returns the endorsement policy as bytes\\n    Policy() ([]byte, error)\\n\\n    // AddOrgs adds the specified orgs to the list of orgs that are required\\n    // to endorse\\n    AddOrgs(roleType RoleType, organizations ...string) error\\n\\n    // DelOrgs delete the specified channel orgs from the existing key-level endorsement\\n    // policy for this KVS key.

       " '_posts/2021-03-01-einstein-book.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Why you should read Einstein-His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson\\nsubtitle: A book recommendation\\ndate: 2021-03-01\\ncategories: [books]\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\nTo summarize, it is one heck of a story, of how a simple patent clerk revolutionizes the way we think about world.\\n\\n1. **Why Einstein is a big deal**: Einstein is a household name. During his era, he was treated as a Rockstar! He was undoubtedly most popular living physicist during his time. He was even offered the presidency of Israel, which he denied. After reading this book, you will really know what makes him so important. What was so revolutionary about his contributions - He really has revolutionized our understanding of the world with this theories - He proved that atoms exist, explained Brownian motion, was the first to propose light is made of packets and explain photoelectric phenomenon, prove that space and time are not absolute, proposed a new theory of gravity which led to many significant discoveries in Cosmology, proved energy and mass are equivalent. \\n\\n2. **How could he come up with Revolutionary ideas**: Special and General theories of relativity are one of the most revolutionary ideas. But how did Einstein come up with such ideas. It turns out that the seeds of disregarding absolute space and time were sown from the readings of Poincare. But Einstein had taken the revolutionary step of also disregarding ether, and showed the relative nature of both space and time.  And there is a interesting journey of General Relativity from equivalence principle to the field equations. Walter Isaacson does a fabulous job to help us understand what qualities of Einstein helped him to take such bold and revolutionary steps and disregard the old theories. For example, there was interesting section in the book which explained - If Poincare already had a feeling that Newton\\'s absolute time is meaningless, why couldn\\'t he come with Special Relativity, what was different about Einstein? It is because, he had this attitude to disregard the authority if he had the right reasons. There is a dialogue by Einstein which repeats several times in the book - \"Blind respect in authority is the greatest enemy of Truth\". \\n\\n3. **Attitude of Einstein towards Science and Life**: Einstein after out of his college, couldn\\'t find any position as a professor or assistant to a professor, despite writing many letters and applications. So he had to settle as a Patent Office Clerk, a job he had got due to his friend\\'s recommendation. In 1905, along with working in the Patent office, he had produced 5 papers that revolutionized Physics(General Relativity(1915) was not there among them!). The year 1905 is regarded as Annus Mirabilis, meaning a miracle year! This fact really intrigues me. Most of us would love to relax in the free time and would not worry much about things outside of job, but Einstein was a passionate guy, he used to finish his job early and would devote rest of the time to his own scientific ideas, and produced revolutionary papers! Also it is a well know fact that Einstein hated Quantum Mechanics. But why on earth would such a revolutionary physicist oppose a revolutionary theory like Quantum Mechanics. In fact, there was a stage in Einstein\\'s life, when every living physicist except Einstein had accepted Quantum Mechanics.  The reason behind this was Einstein\\'s attitude toward science. There is something called \"Uncertainty Principle\" in Quantum Mechanics which states that it is impossible to know the both values of pairs of observables with certainty simultaneously. For example, if you could know position of a particle with great certainty, then it is not possible to know the momentum of that particle with certainty. Also, Quantum Mechanics states, that particles behave differently until observed. Quantum Mechanics was full of such weird things, but it was and is a successful theory is explaining microscopic phenomenon. But for Einstein, reality existed independent of the observer. He used to famously say - \"Do you believe the moon exists, only when you see it\". He also didn\\'t like the uncertainty principle, he proposed several thought experiments, to show that in principle it is possible to know both the observables certainly. But they were proved wrong by his fellow Physicists like Bohr. In 1935, he had proposed EPR paradox, to prove Quantum Mechanics as an incomplete description of reality. It was really a shock to all the Quantum Physicists of that era. And it was unanswered until 1964, by John Bell, which resulted in a more shocking truth - Non locality of the universe. Also Quantum Mechanics was full of probabilities and chance, which Einstein hated. To quote Einstein - \"God does not play dice\". To which Bohr cleverly replied - \"Einstein don\\'t tell God what to do\".Einstein could have followed the trend during his age, and worked on Quantum, and churn out more and more revolutionary papers. But he strongly adhered to his principles. He was working alone on Unification theory - his grand idea of unifying Gravity and Electromagnetism, until the end of his life. Even on his death bed, he scribbled equations related to it! Einstein\\'s true gift was not his intellect, but it was curiosity, stubbornness and true passion for science. During his life time, he also strived to make the world a better place, he strongly promoted pacifism - opposition to war between WWI and WWII, helped the Jewish community. He lived a humble life - dressed in simplest way, He preferred walks and never learned to drive! Through out his biography, we get to know anecdotes, which depict Einstein\\'s simplicity, and it is really amusing that a genius like Einstein lived such a simple life more than an ordinary individual. \\n\\n   Here is one of my favorite anecdotes. Einstein was once invited to a dinner party, and at the party he was sitting in a corner engrossed in scribbling equations on his writing pad. Someone had made an announcement in the party regarding Einstein and all the guests were applauding for him. Einstein was so immersed in his work that he didn\\'t notice it. When he was pointed out that people were applauding, he stood up and started applauding assuming the applause was for someone else.\\n\\n   > “No other man contributed so much to the vast expansion of 20th century knowledge,”. “Yet no other man was more modest in the possession of the power that is knowledge, more sure that power without wisdom is deadly.”  - President Eisenhower\\n\\n4. **Einstein\\'s God**: There is a chapter in the book named \"Einstein\\'s God\". I think there was a need for separate chapter to explain this idea. Einstein was not an atheist, which might be shocking to you as most of the scientists are atheists. But the kind of God Einstein believed in was a complete different one, he believed in something called Spinoza\\'s God. The general notion of God is, a supernatural being who created the universe, watches you, rewards the good and those who pray, punishes the evil. Spinoza\\'s God is a complete different idea of God developed by Baruch Spinoza, a Dutch Philosopher. For Spinoza, God is the universe and nature itself, the idea of God is not individuated and God is impersonal. The general notion of praying to God, is to praise God and ask God to change things as per one\\'s comfort. But for Spinoza, to pray God means to try understand the laws of universe through Natural Sciences, Philosophy and Psychology, by reasoning and logic. Spinoza\\'s God is free from superstitions and gives a complete new perspective of God as the universe and its laws and helps humanity to rise above individual\\'s selfish concerns. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVEeXjPiw54) by The School of Life YouTube Channel does a great job in explaining Spinoza\\'s ideas. I highly recommend you to watch it.  \\n\\n   >  “I believe in Spinoza’s god, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a god who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”\\n   >\\n   >  -Einstein\\n\\n5. **To know truths about Einstein\\'s life**: In this internet age, we see many fake stories of Einstein from incredible sources like \"Einstein failed in his Math tests\", \"Einstein was bad at physics during his college\", Einstein giving some statement of Law of Attraction. Many people who want to spread their useless ideas, write something and say Einstein said it. This is really misleading, and at times really gets on my nerves.\\n\\n   - Einstein had mastered Integral and Differential Calculus before age of 15\\n\\n     > In 1935, a rabbi in Princeton showed him a clipping of the Ripley’s column with the headline “Greatest Living Mathematician Failed in Mathematics.” Einstein laughed. “I never failed in mathematics,” he replied, correctly. “Before I was fifteen I had mastered differential and integral calculus.”\\n\\n   - Einstein did really fail, but it was in experimental physics class. But it was because Einstein was not interested  and didn\\'t attend those classes regularly, in the class of experimental physics.\\n\\n     > Einstein’s impertinence also got him into trouble with the Polytechnic’s other physics professor, Jean Pernet, who was in charge of experimental and lab exercises. In his course Physical Experiments for Beginners, Pernet gave Einstein a 1, the lowest possible grade, thus earning himself the historic distinction of having flunked Einstein in a physics course. Partly it was because Einstein seldom showed up for the course. At Pernet’s written request, in March 1899 Einstein was given an official “director’s reprimand due to lack of diligence in physics practicum\\n\\n     But when he attended he did things in his own way\\n\\n     > On those occasions when Einstein did deign to show up in Pernet’s lab, his independent streak sometimes got him in trouble, such as the day he was given an instruction sheet for a particular experiment. “With his usual independence,” his friend and early biographer Carl Seelig reports, “Einstein naturally flung the paper in the waste paper basket.” He proceeded to pursue the experiment in his own way. “What do you make of Einstein?” Pernet asked an assistant. “He always does something different from what I have ordered.” “He does indeed, Herr Professor,” the assistant replied, “but his solutions are right and the methods he uses are of great interest.\"\\n\\n     And there are countless other quotes on the internet, where Einstein is quoted for things he never said. Next time, when you read or hear of something, and if it claims that Einstein told it or it happened in Einstein\\'s life. Be vigilant, check if its a credible source or not!\\n\\n     ![Don\\'t Misquote Einstein](https://louisem.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fake-einstein-quotes.jpg) \\n\\n## Interesting events - Ironies\\n\\nIf you have read the book, or are aware of Einstein\\'s biography, like me you might have noticed some of the ironic events. Here I wish to write some of them, that I remember, because I found  them interesting.\\n\\n1. Though Poincare was the first to disregard the idea of absolute time. Einstein was the one who had come up with the Special theory of relativity by considering the concept of ether superfluous. Ironically, even after Einstein had developed Special Relativity, Poincare didn\\'t fully accept the ideas.\\n\\n   > Until his death in 1912, Poincaré never fully gave up the concept of the ether or the notion of absolute rest. Instead, he spoke of the adoption of “the principle of relativity according to Lorentz.” He never fully understood or accepted the basis of Einstein’s theory. “\\n\\n   \\n\\n2. Planck had developed the theory that Energy comes in quantized forms(in discrete levels), to explain some experimental data. But it was Einstein who gave the physical meaning to that concept telling that Light can be considered as stream of packets of Energy(now called photons). And he further used this idea to explain Photoelectric effect, for which he went on to win the Nobel Prize. But surprisingly,  Planck did not like the idea the light consists of packets, though the theory that was developed by Einstein was a child of his own ideas!\\n\\n   > “Among the great problems abundant in modern physics, there is hardly one to which Einstein has not made a remarkable contribution..........That he might sometimes have overshot the target in his speculations, as for example in his light quantum hypothesis, should not be counted against him too much.\\n   >\\n   > -an excerpt from a letter,written by Planck\\n\\n3. Einstein had really made significant contributions to Modern Physics, and his theories have changed the perspective physicists looked at the world. In 1919, Sir Arthur Eddington conducted an experiment to confirm the predictions of Einstein\\'s General Relativity. It is after this incident, that Einstein had become a celebrity. He was as popular as Charlie Chaplin! And it was indeed a revolutionary theory, as it gave a new picture of gravity, different from the one Newton proposed. His theories were so revolutionary that he was sure that he would someday win Nobel Prize. And there was already a contract made that on winning the Nobel Prize, he would give the money to his divorced wife   Mileva. It seemed obvious to everyone, Einstein would win the Nobel Prize but the question was when and for what! Undoubtedly, Relativity is the most significant contribution of Einstein, but during those days even after being experimentally proved right, relativity was still under debate. So in the end, the Nobel Prize was given to Einstein for Photoelectric effect. \\n\\n4. Hermann Minkowski was a mathematics professor at ETH, who called Einstein a lazy dog during his college days, because he avoided his challenging courses. But after Einstein had developed Special Relativity, Minkowski was astonished and he told Max Born \"*It came as a tremendous surprise, for in his student days Einstein had been a lazy dog, He never bothered about mathematics at all*\". He later developed a mathematical theory of space-time to explain Special Relativity geometrically. Einstein first thought it was some kind of Mathematical sophistry, and used to joke that \"*Since the mathematicians have grabbed hold of the theory of relativity, I myself no longer understand it*\".   But later, Einstein had to the same idea of space-time, which he previously mocked to develop General Relativity. \\n\\n   > .......That realization would sink in a decade later, when he was wrestling with the geometry of his theory of gravity and found himself forced to rely on the help of a math professor who had once called him a lazy dog. “I have become imbued with great respect for mathematics,” he wrote to a colleague in 1912......\\n\\nUnfortunately, Minkowski was not there to witness General Relativity\\'s development. He died in 1907, and legend has it declared that \"*“What a pity that I have to die in the age of relativity’s development*\".\\n\\n## Footnotes\\n\\n- Funny Image to depict mis-quoting of Einstein, obtained from  [36 Famous Albert Einstein Quotes That Will Blow Your Mind (louisem.com)](https://louisem.com/64476/famous-einstein-quotes). \\n\\n  \\n',\n",

       " '_posts/2021-04-23-go-json-res-parse.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Parsing HTTP response in Golang\\nsubtitle: \\ndate: 2021-04-23\\ncategories: [programming]\\n---\\n\\nRecently, while writing some code in Golang, I had to make HTTP requests and use the response. The response obtained is a string and it needs to parsed, which was kind of frustrating process(it is really smooth in other languages like JS and Python). Many sources suggest to define a struct and Parse, which is actually a good way. But I wish to write less for sake of simplicity. So in this post, I attempt to parse the different cases of JSON response with less lines of code, though it is not a recommended way!\\n\\n## Making HTTP request\\n\\nSuppose you want to making a GET request with headers, you can do it with the following code \\n\\n```go\\nfunc MakeRequest(URL string) string{\\n\\tclient := &http.Client{}\\n\\treq, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", URL, nil)\\n\\treq.Header.Set(\"Header_Key\", \"Header_Value\")\\n\\tres, err := client.Do(req)\\n\\tif err != nil {\\n\\t\\tfmt.Println(\"Err is\", err)\\n\\t}\\n\\tdefer res.Body.Close()\\n\\n\\tresBody, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)\\n\\tresponse := string(resBody)\\n\\n\\treturn response \\n}\\n```\\n\\n## 1. Suppose the response is a JSON {}\\n\\nFor example, the response is \\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\"name\": \"raghav\",\\n\"age\": 19\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen to parse it\\n\\n```go\\nres := MakeRequest(api_url) // Making the request\\nresBytes := []byte(res) // Converting the string \"res\" into byte array\\nvar jsonRes map[string]interface{} // declaring a map for key names as string and values as interface \\n_ = json.Unmarshal(resBytes, &jsonRes) // Unmarshalling\\n// I SKIPPED THE ERROR HANDLING FOR BREVITY, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT\\n```\\n\\nYou can get the individual values from the map like in below code. Note the typecasting done. For example \"raghav\"  and 19 are of interface{} type. Mostly, they are useful if they are of string and integer type. Typecasting to string is straight forward as you can see below. But for integers, using the same way doesn\\'t work. Below is the right way to do it. (refer [Mujibur\\'s answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18041334/convert-interface-to-int))\\n\\n```go\\nname := jsonRes[\"name\"].(string)\\nvar age int = int(jsonRes[\"age\"].(float64))\\n```\\n\\n## 2. Suppose the response is an array []\\n\\nFor example, if the response is\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n {\\n   \"name\": \"raghav\",\\n   \"age\": 19\\n },\\n {\\n   \"name\": \"kau\",\\n   \"age\": 20\\n }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nTo parse it\\n\\n```go\\nres := MakeRequest(API_URL) // Making the Request\\nresBytes := []byte(res) // Converting the string \"res\" into byte array \\nvar resArr []map[string]interface{} // declaring an array of maps with key names as string and values as interface{}\\n_ = json.Unmarshal(resBytes, &resArr) // Unmarshalling\\n// I SKIPPED THE ERROR HANDLING FOR BREVITY, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT\\n```\\n\\nTo access values\\n\\n```go\\nfor i := range resArr {\\n    name := resArr[i][\"name\"].(string)\\n    var age int = int(resArr[i][\"age\"].(float64))\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## 3. Suppose the response contains nested JSON\\n\\nLike below, value of \"details\" is a JSON again\\n\\n```go\\n{\\n\"name\": \"raghav\",\\n\"details\": {\\n     \"city\": \"hyd\"\\n   }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe just do the type casting once again\\n\\n```go\\nres := MakeRequest(api_url) // Making the request\\nresBytes := []byte(res) // Converting the string \"res\" into byte array\\nvar jsonRes map[string]interface{} // declaring a map for key names as string and values as interface{}\\n_ = json.Unmarshal(resBytes, &jsonRes) // Unmarshalling\\n\\n// Type casting again so that interface{} -> map[string]interface{}\\ndetails_map := jsonRes[\"details\"].(map[string]interface{}) // type the interface again to a map with key string type and value as interface\\ncity := details_map[\"city\"].(string)\\n```\\n\\n## 4. Suppose the response contains a array as value of some key\\n\\nLike below, the value of \"interests\" is an array \\n\\n```json\\n{\\n   \"name\": \"raghav\",\\n    \"interests\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", 1]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe need to typecast the array to access its items\\n\\n```go\\nres := MakeRequest(api_url) // Making the request\\nresBytes := []byte(res) // Converting the string \"res\" into byte array\\nvar jsonRes map[string]interface{} // declaring a map for key names as string and values as interface \\n_ = json.Unmarshal(resBytes, &jsonRes) // Unmarshalling\\n\\n// interface{} -> []interface{}\\narr := jsonRes[\"interests\"].([]interface{}) // type the interface again to a array of interfaces\\nfor i := range arr {\\n    arr_item := arr[i] // you can do the type casting as per ur requirements here\\n}\\n```\\n\\n',\n",

On the activism side, he played a major role in preventing the Online Privacy act through SOPA. I have just mentioned the key points, to really know and understand Aaron\\'s Legacy, I highly recommend you to watch this documentary - [The Internet\\'s own Child: The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ). Aaron used to blog regularly on [his site](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/).  Many of his blogs have been collected in a book by name - `The Boy who could change the World` .Not a Modest title, but for a great thinker like Aaron, the title seems nothing wrong. The book has categorised Aaron\\'s blogs into the categories - Free Culture, Computers, Politics, Media, Books & Culture, Unschool. (I have read the blogs from all categories except Politics and Media)\\n\\nThe thing that amazes me is the things that Aaron thought and blogged about when he was so young. Such ideas can\\'t even be captured by the majority of us through out our live span. Yet Aaron was able to write about them openly, with a great clarity at a very young age. \\n\\n# What\\'s in this blog\\n\\nIn this blog, I summarised some of his blogs I read. Because I felt these were important enough to revisit(and also I wanted to practice some writing). In the summaries here, I have included only the important points and the big picture without getting into the details. If you find the summary interesting and wish to learn the details, you can click on the title and read the full original blog on Aaron\\'s website.  In Aaron\\'s blogs, one can find some amazing lines, written very cleverly. At such places, I have quoted the original words in block-quote and sometimes italic.\\n\\n# Recommendations\\n\\nSince, there are too many blogs, and not everyone might be interested in reading all of them.

There’s no ethical problem.\\n\\n> Downloading may be illegal. But 60 million people used Napster and only 50 million voted for Bush or Gore. We live in a democracy. If the people want to share files then the law should be changed to let them.\\n\\n### [UTI Interview with Aaron Swartz (Age-17)](https://archive.org/download/AaronSwartz20040123UTIInterview/Aaron-Swartz-2004–01-23-UTI-interview.html)\\n\\n(I have put only few questions)\\n\\nQ: Hey. Who are you?\\n\\nAaron:\\n\\n- Well, I’m trying to figure that out myself, actually. Broadly, though, I’m a teenage kid who’s interested in improving the world (mostly through law, politics, and technology).\\n\\n- This year, I’m going to try to update my weblog daily with interesting thoughts, program some interesting new website software, and work on some website projects that help people better understand what’s going on in American politics\\n\\nQ: Some people don’t take you seriously because you’re a lot younger than them. What do you think causes this?\\n\\nAaron:\\n\\n- I think there are several reasons. First, people generalize: “Well, most kids I’ve met are pretty dumb, this guy’s a kid, so he’s probably pretty dumb too.”\\n- ...one of the things about kids is that they don’t really know a lot of what you can’t say. So when kids say perfectly reasonable things that you’re not really supposed to say, they just write it off as “Kids say the darnedest things!” and “He just doesn’t know better.”\\n- Internet is how it’s helped me overcome a lot of these things—first, because your age isn’t immediately obvious every time you speak (as it is when someone looks at you), and second, because geeks seem a lot more willing to treat people based on what they can do rather than who they are.\\n\\nQ: One thing I’ve noticed while using open-source software or other free software is that it usually tends to have a very poor user interface. Since these guys are all out to beat Microsoft and other “bigco”s in their own game, why is no or little attention paid to the most important part of the software, the UI? UI designing standards are standards just as the other standards they embrace, right? Or is it all just laziness; to make the product work is enough?\\n\\nAaron:\\n\\n- Well, for most of these programmers UI is hard, because they don’t understand it. They see things textually, not visually\\n- The free software culture comes very much from the Unix culture, and Unix is very much expert-oriented. Experts don’t need “good UI”—they know exactly what to do already and they just want to be able to do it as fast as they can.\\n- This is related to the other problem, which is that free software programmers code mostly for themselves. And since they completely and intuitively understand the software, it doesn’t seem like the UI is bad to them—to them, it makes perfect sense\\n\\nQ: What would you like to say to all the people out there?\\n\\nAaron: Think deeply about things. Don’t just go along because that’s the way things are or that’s what your friends say. Consider the effects, consider the alternatives, but most importantly, just think.\\n\\n*(I have chosen very few questions here, there are many more on the original resource)* \\n\\n### [Jefferson: Nature Wants Information to Be Free  (Age-17)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001115)\\n\\nSince many have said that my view of copyright and patent law is childish and held merely because I grew up with Napster and do not write for a living, I thought I’d investigate some more respectable views on the subject\\n\\n- Judging from his letter to Isaac McPherson, Jefferson’s thoughts are thus: \\n\\n> No one seriously disputes that property is a good idea, but it’s bizarre to suggest that ideas should be property. Nature clearly wants ideas to be free! While you can keep an idea to yourself, as soon as you share it anyone can have it. And once they do, it’s difficult for them to get rid of it, even if they wanted to. Like air, ideas are incapable of being locked up and hoarded.\\n> \\n> And no matter how many people share it, the idea is not diminished. When I hear your idea, I gain knowledge without diminishing anything of yours. In the same way, if you use your candle to light mine, I get light without darkening you. Like fire, ideas can encompass the globe without lessening their density.\\n>\\n> Thus, inventions cannot be property. Sure, we can give inventors an exclusive right to profit, perhaps to encourage them to invent new useful things, but this is our choice. If we decide not to, nobody can object.\\n\\n  (I am not directly quoting Jefferson here, I am translating what he said to modern English and omitting a bit, but I have not put any words in his mouth—Jefferson said all these things.)\\n\\n- The first thing to note is that Jefferson may have been the first to say, in essence, “Information wants to be free!” (Jefferson attributed this will to nature, not information, but the sentiment was the same.) Thus, all those people who dismiss this claim as absurd have some explaining to do.\\n\\n### [Guerilla Open Access Manifesto](https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt)\\n\\n***Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves***\\n\\nMost of the world\\'s scientific and cultural knowledge is digitally locked by greedy private organisations in form of books and journals. The scientific research is mostly funded by the tax payers. And yet if ordinary tax payers wants to read a journal(which is outcome of the research they have funded), they are asked to pay for it. Only people at top universities are privileged to get access to these journals. This is unacceptable and there is a need to fight back.\\n\\nSo, people who have the priviledge to these journals have the moral duty to make the documents openly available to everyone. This is not a crime or immoral ...\\n\\n\\n> It\\'s called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn\\'t immoral — it\\'s a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy. \\n\\n\\n\\n> There is no justice in following unjust laws.

There are several good TV show reviews, introductory subject guides. But they are found only by chance. There is a need for way to organize such large amount of information. This seems impractical, but projects like Dictionary and Encyclopedia have shown that it is possible.\\n\\nWhile such projects required subjects experts to be gathered at one place along with funding, in the current era with the Internet one can avoid that. Wikipedia is the best example, written by random people but not subject experts\\n\\nAnother example is Napster. Within months, there was a nearly complete music library. The contributors to this project didn’t even realize they were doing this! They all thought they were simply grabbing music for their own personal use. Yet the outcome far surpassed anything consciously attempted.\\n\\nThe Internet fundamentally changes the practicalities of large organization projects. Things that previously seemed silly and impossible, like building a detailed guide to every television show, are now being done as a matter of course. It seems like we’re in for an explosion of such modern reference works, perhaps with new experiments into tools for making them.\\n\\n### [The Techniques of Mass Collaboration: A Third Way Out](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/masscollab2) (Age-19)\\n\\nIn this blog, an interesting debate between  Tim Berners Lee(Founder of Web) and Peter Norvig(from Google) is mentioned,  it is called the Million Dollar Code vs Million Dollar Markup, name coined by Mark Pilgirm. Tim Lee argued that through Semantic web, that means by websites providing more meta data in a more sophisticated manner(using RDFs), we can make machines understand the documents easily. But Peter\\'s argument was the users will inevitably create a mess while publishing any documents, and it is the job of machines via complicated code(million dollar code) to search through the mess.\\n\\n(*It is interesting that in today\\'s world, Million dollar code has been a huge success and Million Dollar Markup isn\\'t so widely a popular idea*)\\n\\nAaron argues that there is another way - Million Dollar users. One like Wikipedia, where one specifies the format in which users can put the data is a specific format , and later users can work together to resolve the conflicts.\\n\\nTime has published the [roadmap for Semantic web](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html) in 1998, but things didn\\'t go/are not going as planned.\\n\\n### [Wikimedia at the Crossroads (Age-19)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/wikiroads)\\n\\nIn 2006, when Aaron visited the international Wikimedia conference, he was unhappy with the way how the way work was going on at site administrators. They were mostly absorbed by issues of the present than thinking about grander visions.\\n\\n> second group[site administrators] was almost the opposite of the first[volunteer crew of hackers]. With a few notable exceptions, when they were off-stage they talked gossip and details: how do we make the code stop doing this, how do we get people to stop complaining about that, how can we get this other group to like us more\\n\\nSo, after consideration he decided to run for a seat on Wikimedia Foundation\\'s Board. In the following series of blogs, he writes about wikipedia and talks about some deep issues. The blogs are really thought provoking, and give an insight about how and why actually wikipedia is a huge success. But the sad part of the story is Aaron lost the election. This was mostly because of the internal politics, more on this in the later sections.\\n\\n### [Who Writes Wikipedia](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia)\\n\\nJimbo Wales, the face of Wikipedia, claimed that most of the wikipedia was written by a regular group of users(around 500) and it mostly follows the 80-20 rule: 80% of the work is done by 20% of the users. He made this claim at many talks. To support his statement, he counted the number of edits and found it was tighter than the 80-20 ratio, \\n\\n> it turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users … 524 people. … And in fact the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.” The remaining 25% of edits, he said, were from “people who [are] contributing … a minor change of a fact or a minor spelling fix … or something like that.”\\n\\nThis was a shocking truth because Wikipedia is largely believed to be as the success of large diverse community present all over the world. But the fact that wikipedia is written by group of 1000 people makes a difference, not only for the public but also for the people who run wikipedia. It is an important to keep in mind while making policies on to whose voice they should hear.\\n\\nMany, including Aaron were skeptical about this and Aaron decided to do his research. Aaron took random articles, and instead of counting the number of edits, he checked the amount of letters that were contributed by each user. It turned out that though the large number of edits were made regularly by a regular set of people, the actual bulk of the content was contributed by users who didn\\'t even have an account. Though they had made less edits, it is these users, who wrote the actual content.\\n\\n> But when you count letters, the picture dramatically changes: few of the contributors (2 out of the top 10) are even registered and most (6 out of the top 10) have made less than 25 edits to the entire site. In fact, #9 has made exactly one edit — this one! \\n\\nAnother such example\\n\\n>  the largest portion of the Anaconda article was written by a user who only made 2 edits to it (and only 100 on the entire site). By contrast, the largest number of edits were made by a user who appears to have contributed no text to the final article (the edits were all deleting things and moving things around).\\n\\nTo summarise, outsiders make an edit to add large chunk of information, which he or she knows well. And later insiders, who are well aware of syntax and policies of wiki make several minor edits formatting the article like changing the category name.  The idea that Whales had, is similar to the Britannica Encylopedia is run by formatters, not contributors. Aaron writes\\n\\n> Even if all the formatters quit the project tomorrow, Wikipedia would still be immensely valuable. For the most part, people read Wikipedia because it has the information they need....\\n>\\n> ......The formatters aid the contributors, not the other way around.\\n\\n*(This blog by Aaron proves the fact that wikipedia is a massive success because of its large community, and its model is different from any other corporate company, where a set of people are paid to do their job. Wikipedia is successful because people contribute information because they feel it is important.*\\n\\n*Sadly, this blog had a slight negative impact on Aaron\\'s votes. The majority of the people who vote are the insiders. And the outsiders, who contribute to the articles, either don\\'t have an account or are not eligible to vote, due to their fewer edit counts. Nevertheless, Aaron writing the truth despite keeping all of it in mind is really inspiring!)*\\n\\n### [Who runs Wikipedia](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whorunswikipedia)\\n\\nWhen Aaron spoke about adding some new features to Wikipedia in a conference, the audience, who were mostly hackers were skeptical about it and began suggesting that users won\\'t do this and bad things might happen. And Aaron\\'s reply was an interesting one...\\n\\n> I had come here five years ago and told you I was going to make an entire encyclopedia by putting up a bunch of web pages that anyone could edit, you would have been able to raise a thousand objections: It will get filled with vandalism! The content will be unreliable! No one will do that work for free!\\n>\\n> And you would have been right to. These were completely reasonable expectations at the time. But here’s the funny thing: it worked anyway.\\n\\nSource of Wikipedia\\'s success is the community\\'s volunteerism. When wiki articles are vandalised, the malicious edits are undone is seconds, because a voluntary group of people care enough about the site to feel responsible for it, they get upset when someone messes up the site.\\n\\nWikipedia\\'s problems have arised when specific people are given specific powers. Aaron writes\\n\\n> Wikipedia’s biggest problems have come when it’s strayed from this path, when it’s given some people official titles and specified tasks. Whenever that happens, real work slows down and squabbling speeds up...\\n>\\n> The more frightening problem is that people love to get power and hate to give it up. Especially with a project as big and important as Wikipedia, with the constant swarm of praise and attention, it takes tremendous strength to turn down the opportunity to be its official X, to say instead “it’s a community project, I’m just another community member”\\n\\nThe sad part about it is, people who have devoted time to the project, expect something in return. And so, the trend is clear: more power, more people, more problems. It’s not just a series of mistakes, it’s the tendency of the system.\\n\\n> Just as Wikipedia’s success as an encyclopedia requires a world of volunteers to write it, Wikipedia’s success as an organization requires the community of volunteers to run it. On the one hand, this means opening up the Board’s inner workings for the community to see and get involved in. But it also means opening up the actions of the community so the wider world can get involved. Whoever wins this next election, I hope we all take on this task.\\n\\n### [Making more Wikipedians](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedians)\\n\\nWikipedia was recognized by 10% of Americans. What about the rest 90%? Does Wikipedia need more marketing? This is silly. Wikipedia\\'s users have diverse background, It is the users who can promote Wikipedia with people, who have common interests. Aaron writes...\\n\\n> Wikipedia’s users come from all over society: different cultures, different countries, different places, different fields of study. The physics grad students who contribute heavily to physics articles are in a much better position to promote it to physicists than a promotional flack from the head office. The Pokemon fan maintaining the Pokemon articles probably knows how to reach other Pokemaniacs than any marketing expert.\\n\\nBut there are other difficulties. Sometimes, users who sincerely contribute to an article, get their changes undone by someone else. This really pisses off individual who spend their time and effort. Another problem - it has become difficult for users to make an edit on wiki page. In fact, Richard Stallman, once himself complained that in a conference that it would take him an enormous time to fix an error he noted and word would probably just get reverted.\\n\\nThe problem of users having a difficult time to edit is not just solved by new clearer interface. But also has to involve the community by giving talks, demos and tutorial. Aaron writes \"*The best interface in the world is no substitute for real instruction and even the clearest document explaining our principles will be ignored in a way that a personal presentation won’t*\".\\n\\nThere is a need for enforcing policies which prevent  turning valuable newcomers away and educate them, instead of alientating them. There can be some sort of Complaint system, where people like Stallman can file their complaints and keep track of it. Aaron ends the blog with...\\n\\n> This is just one idea, of course, but it’s an example of the kinds of things we need to think about. Wikipedia is visited by millions each day; how do get them to contribute back their thoughts on the article instead of muttering them under their breath or airing them to their friends?\\n\\n \\n\\n###  [Making more Wikipedias](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/morewikipedias)\\n\\nWhat made Wikipedia work? The question hasn\\'t got enough attention it deserves.  Tech Industry reduces websites to their technology like for them Wikipedia is an instance of wiki software, Reddit is a voting platform. Building a successful community like Wikipedia is tough, it requires the right combination of technology, rules and people.\\n\\nCollaborative work is not a new thing. Books have been co-authored but generally by a small number of people. People have written encyclopedias, but it was only a by a set of people, who were assigned tasks specifically. People have collaborated online but generally to discuss a specific topic or writing specifications on forums, IRCs or mailing lists. But in the case of Wikipedia, people have come together to build Wikipedia. It is a community setup to make itself. There are a lot of things unknown to us about such kind of collaboration.\\n\\nWikipedia\\'s innovation comes from radical collaboration. Instead of small people working together, the entire world was invited to take part. Instead of assigning tasks, it let anyone work on anything they wanted. Instead of assigning someone in charge, it let people to sort things for themselves. Yet, all this was towards making a very specific product. Wikipedia\\'s success can\\'t be extended by simply installing more copies of wiki software!\\n\\n*Aaron points out that it is an important questions to think about - What key principles led to radical collaboration? And further, we need to figure out what sorts of projects, is this good for? What rules need to be put? What kind of software needs to be used?* \\n\\n> These questions can’t be answered from the armchair, of course. They require experimentation and study. And that, in turn, requires building a community around strong collaboration itself. It doesn’t help us much if each person goes off and tries to start a wiki on their own. To learn what works and what doesn’t, we need to share our experiences and be willing to test new things — new goals, new social structures, new software.\\n\\n### [Code, and Other Laws of Wikipedia](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/wikicodeislaw)\\n\\n\"Code is Law\", Lawrence Lessig famously said. Software regulates one\\'s behaviour online just like formal law regulates one\\'s behaviour in public. In fact software\\'s regulation is more effective. If a software prevents user on typing some word then it is more effective than any law brought to regulate speech. \\n\\nThere was a presentation in a conference, on usability of Wikipedia. After the talk, there was a debate among programmers over topics like should Wikipedia be easy enough to use, should confused users be allowed to add their content anyway only to be later corrected by more experienced, should confused users really be allowed to edit software. Though programmers have the expertise to build software, should they be making such choices? Though these choices are technical ones, they have political effects, and hence requires involvement of larger community of people in making any such decisions.\\n\\n> The Wikipedia community is enormously vibrant and I have no doubt that the site will manage to survive many software changes. But if we’re concerned about more than mere survival, about how to make Wikipedia the best that it can be, we need to start thinking about software design as much as we think about the rest of our policy choices\\n\\n###  [(The Dandy Warhols) Come Down](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/comedown)\\n\\nIn this blog, Aaron expresses his grief on the events he learnt about after the Wikipedia Foundation Board election was over. Though, the results were not yet out Aaron knew he would probably loose. And he did end up at 6th position. But the election was held only for 1 seat. But the reasons to why Aaron had lost, after I read caused a mixed emotion of anger and sadness. But reality is often not fair!\\n\\n- Aaron\\'s honest analysis that Wikipedia is largely built by contributors not by a small set of regular insiders. But it is actually these insiders who would vote in election.  \\n\\n  > Many wags have commented on how my campaign was almost destined to lose: I argued that the hard-core Wikipedia contributors weren’t very important, but those were precisely the people who could vote for me — in other words, I alienated my only constituency.\\n\\n- Jimbo Whales, email to Wikipedia community telling whom they should vote for.\\n\\n  > I personally strongly strongly support the candidacies of Oscar and Mindspillage.\\n  >\\n  > […]\\n  >\\n  > There are other candidates, some good, but at least some of them are entirely unacceptable because they have proven themselves repeatedly unable to work well with the community.\\n\\n  Aaron writes that \\n\\n> For those reading the tea leaves, this suggests that the results will be something like: Eloquence, Oscar, Mindspillage. But we’ll see.\\n\\nAnd this really happened. Eloquence won the majority of votes, followed by Mindspillage and Oscar.\\n\\n(*An another interesting, which I found while reading about the election on the web was the election winner Eloquence\\'s candidate statement which can be found [here](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/Board_elections/2006/Candidates/en#Eloquence) . In the end he wrote*\\n\\n> If you don\\'t want to vote for me, please consider voting for [Arnomane](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Arnomane), ***[AaronSw](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw) (yes, he\\'s young, but very clever)***, [Mindspillage](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Mindspillage), or [UninvitedCompany](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:UninvitedCompany). Note that you can vote for multiple candidates, though only one seat is open for election\\n\\nAaron was well recognized well recognized, despite of his very young age(19))\\n\\n\\n\\n The blog ends with words, which were really heartbreaking to read. One could feel the disappointment, frustration. Aaron was someone who truly understood Wikipedia and this fact clear to anyone who read this blogs, I truly wished he had won the election.\\n\\n> The let-down after the election is probably not the best time to make plans but, if I had to, I’d probably decide to stay out of Wikipedia business for a while. It’s a great and important project, but not the one for me.\\n\\n### [Up With Facts: Finding the Truth in WikiCourt (Age-17)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001175)\\n\\nAaron presents the idea of WikiCourt, a platform inspired by style of Wikipedia to come to an objective conclusion on popular controversial statements like \"Gore invented the Internet\".\\n\\nFirst, large claims like \"Gore is a serial liar\" needs to be broken into precise small statements \"Gore claims to have invented the internet\". Then the next step would be to collect the records and put them on a public website. The records can be video tape from CNN in which Gore made the statement, records about Gore\\'s funding of the Arpanet, testimonials from pieces involved. If someone had challenged any piece of evidence, a mini process can be started to resolve it.\\n\\nThe next step would be that in a wiki page, people from each side of the debate would put their arguments with their evidence. And this would continue till the best arguments are put.\\n\\nFinal phase, the hardest phase, a group of people from different sides of political spectrum would look at the arguments and evidences and come to a decision mostly unanimous, for example \"*While Gore’s phrasing was a little misleading, it is clear Gore was claiming to have led the fight for providing funding for research that was later developed into the Internet — a claim that is mostly true. Gore was one of the research’s major backers, although others were involved.*\"\\n\\nThis seems like a awful lot of effort, but in the end there would be a collection of trustable arguments for the many of the controversial topics. The collection could be relied upon in future, as Aaron concludes...\\n\\n> The result would be a vast collection of trustable arguments for many of the hot-topics of the day, a collection that could be relied on through time to give you the fair truth — because everybody had essentially signed off on it (it is publicly-modifiable, after all) And if you look at the effort expended on these claims and political fights, spending a little time getting the facts right seems like a small price to pay.\\n\\n## Computers\\n\\n### [Postel’s Law Has No Exceptions (Age-16)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001025)\\n\\nPostel\\'s law is quoted as \"be conservative in what you put out, but be liberal in what you accept\". The message that the law conveys is that interoperability is a primary concern, and that programs should accept things even if they are against spec for achieving interoperability.\\n\\nAn example of it is, HTML. Though there might be many bugs in an HTML code, the browser never breaks, and browsers make the sense of it. This is an example of Browsers following Postel\\'s law. XML developers decided to fix this, but this never happened, because\\n\\n- The data on the document is not necessarily fixed. If one day, someone happens to add a small piece of data to the document that has XML\\'s exceptions then the whole document would die. For example, `AT&T `should be written as `AT&amp;T` in XML spec. Such imperceptible errors can cause a great damage to the site.\\n- XML apps compete for users. Users may want to read the document inspite a part of it being broken. But if a complete document breaks down, that would be a huge inconvenience for the users.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t mean programs should have to process invalid documents or work hard to guess what the author meant. But things that lead to cause inconvenience on the user\\'s side shouldn\\'t be implemented. Mark Pilgrim was right in saying \"Postel\\'s law has no exceptions\"\\n\\n### [Squaring the Triangle: Secure, Decentralized, Human-Readable Names](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko)\\n\\nZooko\\'s triangle is trilemma for names in Network Protochol like DNS. It states that a naming system can have at most only 2 of the properties(here DNS example is considered)\\n\\n- Human readable: Not a random string of letters\\n- Secure: When your domain name is queried, it actually returns your website\\n- Decentralized: No central authority controls the names.\\n\\nAaron describes a way to have all the three in a system, based on ideas of Bitcoin. This idea has also been implemented by Twister, a p2p micro-blogging platform.\\n\\nLets there be a document called `Scroll`. Scroll contains a series of lines, where each line is a tuple (name, key, nonce). The nonce is a number such that hash of all the data in the scroll above the line have first N bits zero. So, if someone wants to add a new line, they have to calculate the nonce for the new line.\\n\\nTo find a name, ask everyone who has the scroll and accept the result from one having longest scroll. To publish a new line, you calculate the nonce and broadcast the line to everyone you know.\\n\\nIn this system, how do you steal a name? To replace the line, you now have to calculate a new nonce for the line you want to steal and nonce for all the lines after your line. So, if want to steal a line long ago in the scroll, that would require a lot of compute power. Also in the time you have calculated the original scroll would have grown longer, and your scroll would be invalid.\\n\\nTo join the network, one has to know at least one machine containing the scroll. Now, this is vulnerable if the one machine you know is an imposter, you get the wrong scroll. An another option can be, you ask a bunch of machines and keep the scroll that majority give you. Again you are in a vulnerable position, if majority of the nodes are under the control of imposter. \\n\\nPublishing a false scroll results in separation of network. For a machine to publish a scroll, we can ask it to sign it along with the scroll. If the same signature is found on 2 contradicting scrolls, the machine can be rejected from the network.\\n\\nSo, now the names can be human readable, secure provided the majority nodes in the network are honest and its decentralized!\\n\\n\\n\\n### [A Non-Programmer’s Apology (Age-19)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nonapology)\\n\\nAaron in this blog, expresses his desire to shift from programming to activism. A couple of years before he was inspired by Noam Chomsky\\'s ideas on media and politics, through the book Understanding Power and documentary Manufacturing consent.. According to Aaron, Chomsky\\'s Understanding Power book changed his life[*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/epiphany). \\n\\nAaron interestingly mentions Hardy\\'s words from Mathematician\\'s Apology...\\n\\n> A man who sets out to justify his existence and his activities  has only one real defense, namely that “I do what I do because it is the one and only thing that I can do at all well. I am not suggesting  that this is a defence which can be made by most people, since most people can do nothing at all well. But it is impregnable when it can be made without absurdity … If a man has any genuine talent he should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate it to the full.\\n\\nAaron has been a programmer since a very young age and helped co-found Reddit, RSS and many other websites. But Aaron\\'s interests slowly changed as he tried to understand the ways of the world. Aaron was deeply shocked on learning the fact that the world doesn\\'t work he actually thought. Aaron writes in thoughts in another blog....\\n\\n> Reading the book, I felt as if my mind was rocked by explosions. At times the ideas were too much that I literally had to lie down.....I remember vividly clutching at the door to my room, trying to hold on to something while the world spun around.\\n\\nAaron had realized that programming was not he wanted to do his life, though he was very good at it and had great success in the field. He felt that the only way to live his life responsibly was to do something with the truth he had learnt - to explain it to others or do something about it. Hence, in the later years, he deeply became interested in Activism and wrote several blogs on his understanding of politics and Media. \\n\\nAaron wrote this blog as an \"apology\" to conclude that though he has been a very good programmer and a mediocre writer. He wants to continue with writing, as writing is too important!\\n\\n> Perhaps, I fear, this decision deprives society of one great programmer in favor of one mediocre writer. And let’s not hide behind the cloak of uncertainty, let’s say we know that it does. Even so, I would make it. The writing is too important, the programming too unenjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\\n### [On Intellectual Dishonesty (Age-24)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/intellectualdishonesty)\\n\\nDishonesty can be of two kinds\\n\\n- Saying something untrue \\n- Saying with an intent to mislead\\n\\nThere is a different kind called intellectual dishonesty is where you try to convince people that your work is right, though you are fully not convinced. For example, you might do an experiment several times except a time and you are not sure what went wrong(the reasons may be unknown to you). Put publishing that your experiment gives correct result every time is a sign of intellectual dishonesty.\\n\\nScience requires a lot of intellectual honesty because it makes claim to posterity. Hence it is asked to show your work in advance, so that others can see if you are missing something.\\n\\n> intellectual honesty requires bending-over-backwards to provide any evidence that you might be wrong, *even if you’re convinced that you are right*.\\n\\n### [A Unified Theory of Magazines (Age-19)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/unifiedmagazines)\\n\\nSuccessful websites like Reddit, Wikipedia are successful because they are not just interactive pages, they are communities. They allow groups groups of like-minded people to congregate and do things. But magazines are different. \\n\\nMagazines export  communities to the readers.  Instead of like minded people coming together, it provides the feeling of being part of community by reading the ideas. Scientific magazines export the culture of science, so that people can get a piece of the lab coat life.\\n\\n> Run down the list and in pretty much every case you scratch a magazine, you find an exported community. Magazines that want to succeed will have to find one of their own.\\n\\n### [The Smalltalk Question (Age-19)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/smalltalkq)\\n\\nWhen you meet someone in a party, with what question do you start your conversation with?\\n\\n- \"How ya doin’?\" - its just a mere formality\\n- \"What do you do?\" - seems like you are more interested in occupation of the person, might be annoying\\n- \"Where are you from?\" - less fruitful\\n- \"What’s your major?\" - even if its a college student, many college students have no passion in their major\\n- \"What book have you read recently?\" - not everyone reads!\\n- \"What’s something cool you’ve learned recently?\" - might be difficult question to answer and may lead to hemming and hawing\\n\\nSo, Aaron proposes that the best question to ask would be \"**What have you been thinking about lately?**\" because\\n\\n- Its open ended, it can be about a book, their job and anything they are excited about\\n- It sends a message that thinking about thinking is a fundamental human activity\\n- Easier to answer, no pressure on the person\\n- Thoughts are endlessly varied and can capture person\\'s essence\\n\\n“What have you been working on lately?” can be seen, in this context, to be clearly inferior, although similar.\\n\\n> So, what *have* you been thinking about lately?\\n\\n\\n\\n### School - Given as lecture at Harvard (Age-24)\\n\\n**Schools instil fear and kill curiosity** :\\n\\nBabies when given a toy, play with it, try to understand how it works. Children love to explore curiosity. They love to figure out things themselves by experimenting. They keep regularly asking their parents the question \"why\". But as soon as kids start their schooling, the atmosphere is completely different. They are asked to follow the teacher blindly. Learning via experiment and experience is gone. \\n\\nThe worst part is school instil fear in students. A radical educator named John Holt once asked a class of students what goes through their mind, when the teacher asks them a question. After a long silence, a bold kid replied that they would mostly fear they wouldn\\'t know the answer. They were afraid of failing, being called stupid by the rest of the class. The problem with fear is, it makes you dumb.  As Aaron writes...\\n\\n> Your field of vision literally narrows, you start thinking desperately about the problem at hand—not what you know or what it means, but just whatever you need to say to escape the moment safely....\\n>\\n> ...there’s no time to try to understand what they’re really saying or how it fits into some bigger picture. It’s not the time to get clarification on some point that’s confused you.\\n\\nAs a result, students dSuch drills don’t teach children anything about the world, but it does teach them “skills”—skills like how to follow senseless orders and sit at your desk for hours at a timeevelop strategies to escape from the moment like mumbling with a hope that teacher hears what they want to hear, make statements to cover all possibilities, try figuring out clues from teacher\\'s body language. This is not about learning, this is about survival.\\n\\n**Schools forget to teach the basics:**\\n\\nEric Mazur, a professor at Harvard University once wanted to test student\\'s understanding of the basics, they had learnt in their previous years. So he posted 2 kinds of question on electricity in the exam. The first one was a numerical problem, not a direct one though, which required basic Algebra and knowing some basic laws. \\n\\n![The numeric question](https://imgur.com/0CFtbcJ.png)\\n\\nAnd while the second one was a conceptual question, didn\\'t contain any numbers, but the question was posed to test the basic understanding of current flow in the different circuits.\\n\\n![basic question](https://imgur.com/WZYanPR.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nBut outcome was shocking\\n\\n- Some regarded the conceptual question as the hardest question\\n- Some said they didn\\'t know how to get started\\n- Some had written 6 pages, hoping that the right answer would be covered somewhere.\\n\\nEric was shocked to see that many have aced the traditional question, but flunked the basic conceptual one. But there was no one, who did the reverse. \\n\\nThe same is the case in other fields too.  In case of biology\\n\\n> Even students who have studied biology for years continue to think that characteristics an animal acquires in one generation can be passed down to its children (like the giraffe who stretches its neck further to reach more distant food)\\n\\nIn case of literature\\n\\n> As Richards wrote, “They fail to make out its sense, its plain, overt meaning, as a set of ordinary intelligible English sentences, taken quite apart from any poetic significance.”\\n\\nAaron provides similar examples from Mathematics, Computer Science and economics students failing to have a proper understanding of the basics in their fields.\\n\\n**Schooling as a method to control rather teach**: \\n\\nIn mills of Lowell, many young girls used to work in mills. The girls had to work for 14 hours under harsh working conditions. Though their work was dull, they had plenty of time in hand. Despite having no formal education, the girls read books regularly. They used to attend lectures every winter at a near lecture hall. One of the lectures mentioned that nearly 80% of the hall was filled with these factory girls and they used to take notes diligently. \\n\\nIn 1836, when mill owners decided to cut the girl\\'s pay. As a response to that girls had organized a walk out.  They also organized strikes and made their voice heard in the public\\n\\n> They organized their own newspaper, the Voice of Industry, which they wrote, edited, printed, and sold themselves.... But their writing in the Voice shows that they wanted much more than simply better working conditions. They saw themselves as slaves—wage slaves—and concluded that the solution was not simply to demand that the bosses be nicer to them or pay them more, but to abolish the bosses entirely.\\n\\n*One is almost tempted to call this Marxist, but it was many years before Marx.*\\n\\nBut the mill owners were not happy with this agitation. They fired the workers who were causing trouble. Their another striking plan was to send girls to the school to instil discipline and order among them. The curriculum mostly consisted of memorisation of useless facts. The schooling system had no impact on productivity of the works because of its practically useless curriculum. But the mill owners still insisted on running and building such schools because such type of system was inculcating industrious habits in workers, teaching them to blindly follow the orders of superiors above them. As a manager put it\\n\\n> I have never considered mere knowledge, valuable as it is in itself to the laborer, as the only advantage derived from a good common-school education. I have uniformly found the better educated, as a class, possessing a higher and better state of morals, more orderly and respectful in their deportment, and more ready to comply with the wholesome and necessary regulations of an establishment.\\n\\nThe factory model along with mandatory schooling spread. Towns getting a school was not its growth into a city nor a rise in incomes nor the introduction of expensive machinery, but instead the introduction of the factory system itself. As factories marched across the country, public schools followed.\\n\\nThe same system continues till date. The schooling system curriculum has not changed to include things of practical importance. \\n\\n> They are always followed by calls for “education reform” and “higher standards,” which in practice always translates into the same old “drill and skill” of old. And, of course, that’s exactly the point.\\n\\nThis seems like a conspiracy theory. But if you look back at history, it is just a bunch of mill owners who sent their workers to school, so that they would follow their orders blindly. \\n\\nCurrently, students are just drilled to improve their test scores by teaching special vocab words that will earn them extra points and reminded about how to properly phrase their answers to get the maximum score. This has been a boon to the textbook market who went on to produce more books like workbooks with a goal to train these students for tests.\\n\\nThe effect on the students is heart breaking. \\n\\n> Taught that reading is simply about searching contrived stories for particular “text features,” they learn to hate reading. Taught that answering questions is simply about cycling through the multiple-choice answers to find the most plausible ones, they begin to stop thinking altogether and just spout random combinations of test buzzwords whenever they’re asked a question. “The joy of finding things out” is banished from the classroom. Testing is in session\\n\\n> Such drills don’t teach children anything about the world, but it does teach them “skills”—skills like how to follow senseless orders and sit at your desk for hours at a time.\\n\\nBut may be this was the whole plan. After all, employers seem to like it just fine.\\n\\n### [Welcome to Unschooling (Age-14)](http://web.archive.org/web/20020101214543/http://www.swartzfam.com:82/aaron/school/2001/04/05/)\\n\\nUnschooling someone is surprisingly simple. You first deal with what ever regulations your state requires to home school, then the child simply stays home and explores the world as he pleases. Parents and other adults can provide him with advice and assistance on things he\\'s interested in, but must do their best not to force the kid into things. This is not just to brain wish kids, but it is based on the writings of educator John Holt, which reflects the simple principle that \"kids want to learn!\"\\n\\nThe book - Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewellyn is an incredible guide for unschooling. The book contains 3 parts\\n\\n- why you should not go to school\\n- how to get out of school\\n- what to do once you\\'ve gotten out\\n\\nThe book has plenty of experiences where unschooling has improved family relationships, \"cured\" cases of depression or \"learning disabilities\", and, most importantly, made kids much more happier.\\n\\nStudies have show that unschooled children are successful in real world, and are better at things without taking a conventional course. Also, since they have a lot of time, they also get a hands on experience by working as apprentice or volunteering.\\n\\nAaron also writes how he developed the skill of writing so well...\\n\\n> I learned English not from school, but by writing emails and this column, as well as reading heavily. When I tell this to other students, they say: \"Oh, I wish I could do that, but I don\\'t have enough time.\" Well, if they don\\'t go to school, I\\'m sure that they\\'ll have much more. It\\'s quick and painless: just read interesting books and write about things that you\\'re interested in. Keep doing it and your writing is sure to improve -- no pain or struggle involved.\\n\\nSimilarly, subjects like math and science can also be learnt without school. In schools, students are mostly taught computation and symbol manipulation which are the least interesting parts, and can be done by a simple computer. Math is really about study of patterns and understanding them.  Science in school, is merely reduced to memorization of facts. But science is about questioning and understanding the world around you. \\n\\n> ... scientific explorations need not be limited to her classroom, or any other. Instead, the world around us is an enormous classroom and we merely need the time to explore it, and the drive to ask questions and try to answer them.\\n\\nAaron continues...\\n\\n> As TLH points out, adolescence is one of the most exciting and important times of transformation in a child. Other cultures mark it through strong and powerful experiences: the town coming together to perform a hallowed tribal ritual; sending the child out on a quest or journey making him into a man when he returns; etc. Why do we go on like nothing is happening, throwing our children into a mind-numbing, spine-straightening, painfully useless ordeal\\n\\nBut it seems to most of the people the kids become social hermit through this unschooling. But that is wrong. Meaningful relationships can be made outside of school too. In fact, in school there is hardly time to develop a good relationship. The bonding develops when kids meet outside of the school. \\n\\nAaron from his own experience tells that...\\n\\n> who decided that meaningful relationships could only be had with other people who happen to be in roughly the same physical area at roughly the same age? If anything, this is a severely restrained peer group. I have developed my most meaningful relationships online. None of them live within driving distance. None of them are about my own age. Even among those who I would not count as \"friends\", I have met many people online who have simply commented on my work or are interested by what I do. Through the Internet, I\\'ve developed a strong social network -- something I could never do if I had to keep my choice of peers within school grounds.\\n\\nIn the concluding paragraphs, Aaron expresses his strong hope in unschooling\\n\\n> So many people complain about the quality of our school systems today, and are ready for a change in the system. Unschooling is not only a change -- it\\'s a tidal wave knocking out all that we know and believe about the school system and providing a vastly different -- and better -- alternative.\\n\\nAaron concludes\\n\\n> Finally, I end with a plea. If you have kids, or know kids, who are stuck in the monotony of school, give them an escape route: buy them a copy of Teenage Liberation Handbook. I\\'m sure they\\'ll thank you for it. It\\'s time for the kids to rise up and take control of our lives again. Our slavery has lasted long enough.\\n\\n### [The Writings of John Holt (Age-14)](http://web.archive.org/web/20011222043951/http://swartzfam.com/aaron/school/2001/04/29/)\\n\\nJohn Holt, a radical educator was the guy who invented the concept of unschooling. He was previously a teacher, who worked hard to make learning fun through educational toys and used innovative educational techniques. But he felt something was missing.\\n\\nSo, he stopped teaching and began observing kids. He observed them over an year and took notes, which were also published as a book -  *How Children Fail*. He realized that students were not actually learning, but just merely pretending to have learnt things. He figured out the defence mechanism and strategies that kids developed so that they would not appear stupid in front of the class. This became clear from the balance beam \"experiment\".  The students were given several weights and they had to guess where on the beam to place them to make it balance. And the responses were...\\n\\n> Abby: It might move a little to one side -- not much.\\n> Elaine: It might teeter a little then balance, but not really. (She is covering all the possibilities.)\\n> Rachel: It might balance.\\n> Pat: It will balance pretty much.\\n> [...]\\n> Gary: I think it\\'s just going to go down -- that\\'s safer.\\n> [...]\\n> Gil: May go down a little and then come back up.\\n> Garry: It will be about even.\\n> Betty: I sort of think it\\'s going to balance.\\n> [...]\\n> Betty: I\\'ll say it will, just in case it does, so we won\\'t get too low a score.\\n\\nStudents, here are not interested in knowing the truth. They just don\\'t want to look stupid in front of others, so they make vague statements, hoping it will be interpreted as the right answer.\\n\\nJohn stops working as a teacher and starts spending his time with baby cousins. The children were given interesting toys and they would start to play with it themselves. He noticed that they were observing, experimenting and discovering things better by themselves. So, John didn\\'t interfere except at providing small nudges and moral support at few moments. \\n\\nOne day, he gave the children the balance beam. He puts it at the back of the room and says \"*just some junk I got from Bill Hull. [...] Nothing special; mess around with it if you want to.*\"  They began to play around with it and figured how the thing worked with in half an hour by themselves. When a kid was asked the problem, that John gave previously to the kids(the problem mentioned above), she answered it correctly and showed him how she had figured it out. The kid also remarked that it was *cinchy* and she had no trouble in figuring it out!\\n\\n>  **The reason, why kids earlier had failed to understand, in spite of the laboratory environment setup in class because kids were working on a problem, that was ours not theirs.**\\n\\nKids learn best, through self exploration and discovery. But many teachers don\\'t provide the environment for it. Teachers either want to be a tyrant - \"You better do this\" or a Saints-\"You will thank me for it later\".  In fact, some teachers don\\'t even allow toys thinking that it will slow down the curriculum learning. But that is not how children learn. Instead they learn to hide, play dumb, forget, weasel their way out, or trick you. Worse, they begin to think that this is how to behave in every situation.\\n\\nAnyone working at school should read *How Children Fail* . And anyone with small children  should read *How Children Learn*. \\n\\n>  It describes in detail just that process, and by example, provides ways to keep your children learning their entire life, rather than hating the whole thing and quitting as soon as possible as too many children do. **For some children, it may be too late to unlearn the bad habits they learned in school, but it is certainly never too early.**  \\n\\n### [Apprentice Education (Age-14)](http://web.archive.org/web/20020306075407/http://www.swartzfam.com:82/aaron/school/2001/02/19/)\\n\\nAaron in this blog, presents a idea of building a free and open learning community. The current system of schooling has some important drawbacks\\n\\n- It detaches the one-on-one relationship between Teacher and Student\\n- Very little practical information is provided to the students, majority of learning takes place in job\\n- The curriculum doesn\\'t cover latest ideas and developments\\n\\nAaron writes how he learned to program well, without any formal training\\n\\n> I learned how to program myself through reading programs others had written, and asking questions about them on the Web. Responses to my naive questions were generally courteous and almost always helpful. I got back responses extremely quickly -- rarely longer than a day. And through this method I eventually learned to program. I took no pre-set course, and had no usual instruction. However, while I was able to learn to program through this method, there is no similar system to learn to program *well*, which is usually something altogether different.\\n\\nSo, Aaron proposes a new idea of learn in any field, based on his experience. First find a group of kind, older, wise and respected people in the field and get them on the Internet. Then, take a group of brash, young, naive and impatient kids who are interested field and have them do the same. Then, bring the two together and watch the magic happen.\\n\\nThe old and the Young will learn from each other together joyfully. As Aaron puts it...\\n\\n> The old will explain many things to the young, and the young will teach the old a few things too. The young will get an incredible opportunity to learn the most important things first-hand from the people who use them in real-life; the old will get an opportunity to share the joy of their trade with bright-eyed kids eager to learn it.\\n\\nThe outcomes of this will be tremendous. Some of the best method for explaining something will become well-known, and can be written up. There will be a \"textbook\", not written by experts in the field with dry examples, but a textbook filled with real-life subject matter.\\n\\nAnd everything must be voluntary!\\n\\n> **What\\'s important, however, is that we don\\'t force anyone into this program. Everything must be voluntary, or else we\\'ll lose the magic of community.**\\n\\n> Yet, if we\\'re lucky, and everything succeeds, we\\'ll have built an educational community that\\'s free, enjoyable and available to anyone world-wide. Sure seems like everyone wins to me.\\t\\n\\n### [What It Means to Be an Intellectual (Age-19)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/intellectuals)\\n\\nThere is a social norm that how much we discuss about a topic should be directly proportional to its importance.  For example, spending hours of discussion on politics is accepted as opposed to spending the same hours on discussing punctuation. But there is some kind drive in few people, which causes them to thin deeply about things, irrespective of its outcome or importance. Aaron calls them intellectuals!\\n\\n> ...It’s the tendency to not simply accept things as they are but to want to think about them, to understand them. To not be content to simply feel sad but [to ask what sadness means](http://www.plover.com/blog/aliens/emotions.html). To not just get a bus pass but [to think about the economic reasons getting a bus pass makes sense](http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/weblog/nb.cgi/view/vitanuova/2005/11/04/0). I call this tendency the intellectual.\\n\\nMost people don\\'t think enough. Maybe, because thinking reminds them of school, which they might have not enjoyed. Some People also don\\'t like to think because they are busy doing stuff. They consider thinking as a waste of time, as they believe that it doesn\\'t matter to them.\\n\\nIntellectuals(according to Aaron) spend their most of them their time thinking about details like intricacies in language, something which seems of little importance. But there is a good reason behind it. Language is the medium of thought. Anyone who has thought enough about something would like to communicate these thoughts in a better way to the world. Hence intellectuals write, not because they are paid to, but because they love to. *What good is thinking if you can’t share?*\\n\\n### [Getting It Wrong  (Age-19)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/gettingitwrong)\\n\\nPeople are terrified with getting things wrong. At school, kids are afraid that on giving the wrong answer might make them look stupid. The same is with adults, they are sometimes embarrassed to acknowledge their ignorance while discussions. \\n\\nThis is a serious problem because failing is what we mostly do. We try things that are slightly outside our comfort zone, fail many times, learn from them and improve. That is how we get better at things.  But if people are afraid of failure, they don\\'t even try anything new.\\n\\nThere are 2 ways to fix this\\n\\n- Build an environment preventing failure\\n- Fix people so that they are not embarrassed to fail\\n\\nThe first way is a dangerous way. For example, if you try to build an environment for kids where they don\\'t fail at all, they won\\'t be able to handle failure out in real world. So, a better option would be fix people\\'s self-esteem. But the problem with this is, *self-esteem is like a cushion: it prevents the fall from being too damaging, but it doesn’t prevent the fall.*\\n\\n**The real solution is to detach people\\'s actions from their worth**.  People feel bad because they think failing at something makes a failure.\\n\\n> The real piece, it would seem, is finding some way to detach a student’s actions from their worth. The reason failing hurts is because we think it reflects badly on us. I failed, therefore I’m a failure. But if that’s not the case, then there’s nothing to feel hurt about.\\n\\nThe idea of detachment also has a good psychological background. These are mentioned in the book *[Happiness: Lessons from a New Science](http://books.theinfo.org/go/0143037013)*, showing that Buddhist meditation, Christian belief in God, or cognitive therapy — are happier people, when they are detached from the surroundings.\\n\\nParents should love their children, for who they are rather than on what they do.  When given a chance to ask questions anonymously, people don\\'t hesitate to ask questions that they believe are stupid. While playing a video game alone, kids try again and again to win. So, its easier to try out things freely, when you know no one is watching you. Its because you are aware that it is not going to effect how people see you.\\n\\nHence schools, should discourage this kind of conditional seeing.  As Aaron writes ...\\n\\n> What if school, instead of a bunch of activities you had to march through, was a bunch of activities students could pick and choose from.  When people are no longer marching, it’s hard to be worried about your place in line.\\n>\\n> ..Removing deadlines and requirements should help students live more fully in the moment. Providing basic care to every student should help them feel valued as people.\\n\\n### [Take the Easy Way Out (Age-19)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/easywayout)\\n\\nPeople often tell that there is no substitute for hard work. If you are failing at doing something, \"just try harder!\" they say. It doesn\\'t have to be that way. If your hands hurt while trying to punch a wall, instead of trying to punch harder you should look around for a tool to help you do the job.\\n\\nAaron takes the example of Bemami games, which made the process of learning a music instrument enjoyable instead of tedious. (Readers may watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d2etdDTWoY) video, to get an idea of Bemami games) The reasons why Bemami games are effective are...\\n\\n- You play a real song! Generally, while learning a new instrument people start with baby songs, which might not be exciting. But with Bemami games, you learn while playing a real song. People are excited to learn because they play the music which they enjoyed listening. \\n\\n- It gives feedback on your practice and learning with the concept of skill levels. This also encourages you to keep practising to higher your levels. \\n\\n- In conventional learning, people get stuck when they hit a wrong note, and practice it for a long time. This develops frustration in the learners. But in case of Bemami, the music keeps going. This might seem like a disadvantage, but you are not stuck on a single mistake. *Keeping the music moving forces you to look at the bigger picture.*\\n\\n  > Good designers, when they see people having trouble using something they designed, **don’t tell the user to try harder. They fix the design**. We should take the same attitude when we design our life as well.\\n\\n### [Legacy (Age-19)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/legacy)\\n\\nThe conventional way to measure a person\\'s importance is to see what effect of what he/she has done in a particular field. For example, a supreme court justice lawyers are considered important because their decisions and actions affect an entire nation. But is this the right way to measure legacy? Do ambitious people who want to leave legacy focus on doing things that effect large number of people?\\n\\nAaron says that is a wrong way to measure legacy. Instead, if you want to leave a legacy, you should think how things would be if you wouldn\\'t have done it. Would people\\'s lives be the same, if you didn\\'t do it? For example, academics sometimes chose a field of work, because they believe it is \"hot\"! And they think that they would be famous if they make some discovery in that field. But people like Newton and Darwin didn\\'t work because they felt that they were \"hot\" fields to pursue, but they worked because they felt that their discovery would have some good impact!\\n\\nIf you are a supreme court justice, most of your work would be influenced by politicians above you. But if you really want to leave a legacy, you should care about bringing change in politics and the system. Or if you want to be a professor, instead of just focusing on a getting a job in a university, you should be focusing on changing the nature of the universities.\\n\\nThough it seems that these are dangerous games that require a lot of time, effort and courage to do such things, there is no choice if you genuinely care about leaving a legacy.\\n\\n(This blog is reminiscent of the idea of \"Jumping out of the system\" from GEB. [A blog](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-02-26-stepping-out-of-system/) explaining the idea)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

They let you perform jobs on Github Cloud. But if you are using Github Actions too much, you might run out of the free minutes and you end up paying a lot. It is very likely that you are already paying for a cloud provider like AWS, Digital Ocean or Azure. So, a better idea would be to run the job on the existing cloud itself, instead of paying separately to run on Github cloud. \\n\\nThe best part about Github Actions is they allow you to run these jobs on Self hosted machines. That means when an event happens, Github will send a request to API that you provide to let you know that job needs to be performed. And you can perform the job on your own cloud machine. By using this process, you have 2 advantages\\n\\n- You don\\'t have to pay for Github Actions\\n- You can see checks and logs on Github\\'s interface\\n\\n## Cirun.io\\n\\nSetting up your self hosted runner with Github Actions from scratch is a time taking process. Cirun.io saves your time. Setting up Cirun.io is extremely easy. The rest of blog shows you how to setup self-hosted runner on Digital Ocean using Cirun. The following steps outline process is\\n\\n1. Sign up on Cirun using Github\\n\\n2. Connect Digital Ocean with Cirun.io\\n\\n3. Install Cirun on the Repo \\n\\n4. Add Github Actions file\\n\\n5. Add a `.cirun.yml` file\\n\\n6. Toggle on the Actions on Cirun\\n\\n   Its done!\\n\\nThe first step is a trivial step, just like any other OAuth signup.\\n\\n## Connect Digital Ocean with Cirun\\n\\n1. In the navbar present on the left hand side, click on `Cloud` and click on the `Connect DigitialOcean` button\\n\\n![Click on Cloud](https://imgur.com/XmPyPzN.png)\\n\\n2. Give access to the account that you want to\\n\\n![Give Access to Cirun](https://imgur.com/OKQYUtz.png)\\n\\n## Install Cirun on the repo\\n\\n1. In the Navbar present on the left hand side, click on `Repositories` and click on `Install App on Github`\\n\\n   ![Installing App on Repo](https://imgur.com/5vdrJGP.png)\\n\\n2. Select the organization or your account(like I did)\\n\\n   ![Select Organization](https://imgur.com/tSgeNdM.png)\\n\\n3. Select the repo on which you want to install\\n\\n   ![Select repo](https://imgur.com/rhfeTsI.png)\\n\\n4. Click install \\n\\n   ![Install](https://imgur.com/Z1HWV22.png)\\n\\n   ## Adding Github Actions file\\n\\n   To add the `yaml` file for Github Actions, create a new file, say `demo.yml` at the path `.github/workflows/demo.yml`. Here is a simple action, which does a simple `wget` request when something is pushed to the repo.\\n\\n   ```yaml\\n   name: Sample demo Action\\n   \\n   on:\\n     push\\n    \\n   jobs:\\n     build:\\n       name: Send a GET request via wget\\n       runs-on: self-hosted # THIS IS IMPORTANT\\n       steps:\\n         - name: wget request\\n           run: wget https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt\\n   \\n   ```\\n\\n   \\n\\n**Note that `runs-on` has the value `self-hosted`. The name of machine should not be mentioned in this file.**\\n\\n## Adding .cirun.yml file\\n\\nIn the root of the repository file, create a file named `.cirun.yml` which will be utilized by Cirun to run action on the machine. \\n\\n```yaml\\n# Self-Hosted Github Action Runners on DO via Cirun.io\\n# Reference: https://docs.cirun.io/reference/yaml.html\\nrunners:\\n  - name: Sample action\\n    # Cloud Provider: DigitalOcean\\n    cloud: digitalocean\\n    # Cheapest VM on DigitalOcean\\n    instance_type: s-1vcpu-1gb\\n    # Ubuntu-20.4  image\"\\n    machine_image: ubuntu-20-10-x64\\n    # Path of the relevant workflow file\\n    workflow: .github/workflows/demo.yml\\n    # Number of runners to provision on every trigger on Actions job\\n    count: 1\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe comments in the above code are self-explanatory.\\n\\n## Toggle on\\n\\nIn Cirun Dashboard, click on `Repositories` present on the navbar on left hand side. Toggle on the repo, where you have installed Github Actions\\n\\n![Toggle on](https://imgur.com/iMxRkod.png)\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nTo test lets trigger a commit in README\\n\\n![Trigger a commit](https://imgur.com/y6dKW08.png)\\n\\nIts running!\\n\\n![Its running](https://imgur.com/y0jH9mZ.png)\\n\\nAnd its done!\\n\\n![Done](https://imgur.com/L7kSxSa.png)\\n\\n# Note\\n\\n1. You can see in the above image that some of the previous actions failed. That is because it takes some time for Cirun to start working. So if it fails, check the configuration files once again and if everything seems alright, try triggering another commit after few minutes.\\n\\n2. If its a cronjob, it takes some time to get triggered. If you want to verify if your configurations file are configured right, follow these steps\\n\\n   - Make changes to file present in `.github/workflows` such that action is triggered on a push\\n\\n   - Try making a commit after few minutes. If it still fails, try reading the error logs under Actions tab in Github(a common error is not putting `self-hosted` in the Github Actions file as discussed above)\\n\\n## Turning off\\n\\n1. Vist the Cirun Dashboard\\n\\n2. Click on the `Repositories` on the navbar present on the left hand side\\n\\n3. Click the toggle button beside the repository name you want to turn off\\n\\n   ![Turn off](https://imgur.com/CxjSFyR.png)\\n\\n## How to verify that the Actions are NOT running on Github Cloud\\n\\n- If the `yaml` file in `.github/workflows` folder contains `runs-on: self-hosted`, the action will never run on Github Cloud\\n\\n- You can also check the logs through the below steps:\\n\\n  1. Go to the `Actions` Tab on Github Repository\\'s link by visiting `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME/actions`\\n\\n  2. Click on the `Workflow` that you want to check\\n\\n     ![Click on Workflow](https://imgur.com/L7kSxSa.png)\\n\\n  3. Click on the tag containing the job name\\n\\n     ![Click on Job name](https://imgur.com/NhELaP3.png)\\n\\n  4. Click on the `Set up job` header,  to read the logs. You will find that the `Machine name` or `Runner name` have contain `cirun`, which indicates that the job ran on a machine on another cloud created by Cirun.\\n\\n     ![Machine name or Runner name](https://imgur.com/erMar71.png)\\n\\n(The Actions that run on Github Cloud have different logs. They look something like this \\n\\n![Actions that run on Github Cloud](https://imgur.com/BROBmHq.png))\\n\\n# Thanks\\n\\nThanks to [Amit Kumar](https://twitter.com/iaktech), the founder of Cirun.io, who help us setup Cirun at [Neera.ai](http://neera.ai/). At Neera, we run a cronjob every 10 minutes to update User\\'s pocket articles and Notion documents. Github Actions provides a convenient interface to check the status of Cronjob. With 2 cronjob running every 10 minutes, we were out of free minutes soon after a couple of weeks. Now currently, we run both the cronjobs on Digital Ocean cloud using Cirun.\\n\\nSetting up Cirun was really a smooth experience and done quickly. There are other nice use cases for Cirun like it supports running on GPU, which Github actions does not. Most amazing thing about Cirun is, it is free for open source Projects.\\n\\n![Cirun Supporting Open Source](https://imgur.com/qtcL3u2.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n- Repository Link used for Demo - https://github.com/rakaar/cirun-demo\\n- Video to setup Cirun on AWS Cloud - https://youtu.be/lDx0YVTn6yg (Demo video by Amit Kumar)\\n\\n',\n",

       " '_posts/2023-05-08-Hallucinations review.md': '---\\r\\nlayout: post\\r\\ntitle: I read Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks\\r\\nsubtitle: Book review\\r\\ndate: 2023-05-08\\r\\ncategories: [books]\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nHallucinations, as the name suggests, delves into various clinical case studies where people \"see\" things that don\\'t exist projected onto reality. Oliver Sacks discusses different mental conditions and the types of hallucinations patients experience, such as those associated with Charles Bonnet syndrome, Parkinson\\'s disease, and epilepsy. The book also includes discussions of auditory (hearing things that don\\'t exist) and olfactory hallucinations (smelling things that don\\'t exist).\\r\\n\\r\\nOliver also talks about cases where hallucinations occur in sane people, such as on the threshold of sleep (hypnagogic hallucinations) or just as people rise from sleep (hypnopompic hallucinations). Apart from these, the book covers other fascinating cases like doppelganger hallucinations (where you hallucinate another person just like you) and out-of-body experiences (OBE) where one feels oneself outside of their body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writing is quite enjoyable. Occasionally, you might find yourself bored with the motifs in certain chapters. However, an equal number of times, you come across something truly exciting like an interesting literary reference or a spine-chilling case. For example, consider the following case:\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, a patient diagnosed and treated by Oliver, rushed to him and questioned why Oliver, whom he considered a nice guy, asked him to jump off the hospital roof. Oliver asked the man if he had seen him around, to which the man replied, \"No.\" Oliver suggested that the next time he hears such a voice, he should look around and check. The next day, the man again heard Oliver\\'s voice commanding him to jump off the roof, adding, \"And no need to turn around, because I am already here.\" Fortunately, the man resisted the urge to jump, and after three years of treatment, he eventually recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOliver is also an avid reader and frequently points out popular literature references. Dostoevsky had temporal lobe epilepsy, and it has been observed that people with this condition often have hyper religiosity. I often used to wonder why a rational thinker like Dostoevsky would be so religious. It is a strange realization to learn that the style of his writings may have originated from a physiological dysfunction. Another interesting fact for literary enthusiasts - Guy de Maupassant experienced doppelgÃ¤nger hallucinations, a phenomenon where you hallucinate someone who looks exactly like you.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Paranormal experiences have neurophysiological origins\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever I hear a paranormal story from any of my friends, I wonder about the true rational explanation behind it. I strongly believe that nothing is supernatural and that everything adheres to the laws of physics. This book aims to strengthen such convictions in others as well. Throughout the book, we come across cases where patients experience seemingly paranormal events, such as encountering someone who looks exactly like themselves or hearing a voice just after waking up. In cultures that lack scientific or rational understanding, these experiences often give rise to tales of ghosts and spirits. Realizing that these phenomena have a physiological basis can enlighten many of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Favourite part\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I would like to highlight my favorite part of the book - the chapter titled \"Altered States.\" This chapter was particularly enjoyable for me, as the stories were incredibly *trippy*. The last story, however, was truly moving. During a period in Oliver\\'s life, he had a routine of spending weekends under the influence of *amphetamines*. These dangerous drugs can lead to high blood pressure, and overdoses, which are all too common, can be fatal. After each weekend, Oliver would feel drained and guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, he happen to come across a book on Migranes by Edward Levine. A fat book of around 500 pages written in 1860s. On amphetamines, as he read the book, the emotions because intensified. He felt as though he was writing it, he was living the book. Oliver was really fascinated by Edward\\'s writing, which had a perfect mixture of science and humanism. He read the book in one go straight without moving a muscle. After done with reading, Oliver asked himself who would be Edward of his era. An inner voice answered \"**you**\". Oliver, then decided to start writing his own book. As he describes, the joy he derived from writing the book was *infinitely real*. The story ends with the line *And I never took amphetamines again*.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, he came across a book on migraines by Edward Liveing, a hefty book around 500 pages on migrane, written in1870s.

Oliver was deeply captivated by Edward\\'s writing, which masterfully combined science and humanism. He read the book in one sitting without *moving a muscle*. When he finished reading, Oliver asked himself who would be the Edward Liveing of his time. An inner voice replied, \"**You silly bugger! You are the man.**\".

This contrasts with the common perception that the more substances are an escape from reality. While this may be true in many cases, this story demonstrates that an amplified emotional state, when combined with the right setting - such as reading a book on a subject you deeply care about - can reveal a hidden potential within.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always been captivated by the diverse experiences that the human brain can generate, and this book offers a plethora of such instances.

       " '_posts/2021-10-19-strangeloop-review.md': '---\\nlayout: post\\ntitle: Why you should read I am A Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter\\nsubtitle: A review cum recommendation\\ndate: 2021-10-19\\ncategories: [books]\\nusemathjax: true\\n---\\n\\n\\n## For people in a hurry\\n\\nIt\\'s one heck of a book that anyone can read and everyone must read. The book doesn\\'t require any background. To boil it down, these are the important questions(whether you have asked or not) that are discussed in the book\\n\\n1. What is \"I\"?\\n\\n2. How does consciousness arise, and is it only in humans?\\n\\n3. How we live in each other?\\n\\n4. Is death an instant end?\\n\\n5. Why conscience is the most important unique quality that humans have got?\\n\\n   \\n\\nMost importantly, all these are discussed in Hofstadter\\'s style. There is a great pleasure in reading and understanding things his way.\\n\\nOne of the most fascinating things about we humans is that we not only perceive and think about things around us, but also can think and perceive ourselves-what we call I.  Hofstadter takes you through an amazing journey to explain this phenomenon called \"I\".\\n\\nThe initial half of the book focuses on the reasoning to support Hofstadter\\'s ideas. There is a discussion on Gödel\\'s theorem, analogies, feedback mechanism. But along the journey, you find the book touches the human aspects - what is I, how we affect people we live with, what is death, how strong is the link between you and your physical body, conscience and generosity. It is these aspects, which make me feel that the book is important for everyone to read.\\n\\nBelow, I try to cover all the important ideas of the book in brief, hoping that some of the lines would encourage you to pick up the book.\\n\\n## Hofstadter\\'s level\\n\\n>  *While we all thought in notes, he used to think in chords*. \\n\\nHofstadter proposes that to understand the human mind, one must look at higher levels that are abstract. He argues that studying things at the neuron level will not lead us to any understanding due to the sheer large number of neurons. Instead considering the average effects can give us insights.\\n\\nHe compares this idea to application of *Statistical Mechanics* in *Thermodynamics*. In Statistical Mechanics instead of studying individual particle behaviour, the average effects of large number of particles are considered to understand behaviour of a gas. Hofstadter argues that for the brain we need to have a similar approach - *Statistical Mentalics* and *Thinkodynamics*. \\n\\n*The Conventional levels of study*\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/Tm2YpzQ.png)\\n\\n*Hofstadter\\'s levels*\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/OJNPAnc.png)\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nHofstadter compares studying of human mind at lowest physical level to understanding literature by studying at typographical level. We need to come to a higher level to understand thoughts.\\n\\n## Who shoves whom around inside the cranium?\\n\\n> It ain\\'t the meat, its the motion\\n\\nIn the spirit of understanding at high level, we now discuss an abstract theory that gives us a good model of mind. We all have different concepts in our mind. We have a concept for what a dog is, a concept for what a human is, a concept for what love is, a concept for what envy is. We perceive the world in terms of different concepts. Hofstadter proposes that each concept in human mind is represented by a set of \"symbols\".\\n\\nSymbols are structures in brain that represent each concepts. Just like Genes are chemical entities corresponding to hereditary traits, symbols are neurological entities corresponding to concepts. The firing of neurons in a structure activates a symbol. The activation of different symbols  in brain enable a thought. Hence a thought is essentially a \"dance of symbols\" in the human brain.\\n\\nWe don\\'t yet have enough physical understanding of brain to point out that these particular neurons and these firings point out to these particular thoughts. But this abstract idea of symbols, will help us to answer few important questions as we will see. \\n\\nSo, as we grow, we start developing concepts for many things around us. And these concepts have corresponding symbols. As the symbols keep growing we develop a complex repertoire of concepts, complex enough that there is a concept to represent itself. This concept is called \"I\".  So, essentially what we perceive as I, is a set of symbols in brain that represent itself.\\n\\nA too much hand-wavy explanation, but an analogy from meta-mathematics will  convince you more.\\n\\n## Gödel\\'s proof and new meaning out of a new mapping\\n\\n> The mundane of analogies can reveal deepest roots of human cognition\\n\\nWhile many stare at Gödel\\'s theorem and be fascinated by the fact that logic has inherent limits. Hofstadter saw a new meaning in the proof. The proof is used as an analogy to explain how humans develop the concept of \"I\".\\n\\nIn the beginning of 20th century, mathematicians were shaken by paradoxes that questioned the foundations of mathematics. The most popular one among them is Russel\\'s paradox. The barber\\'s version of the paradox is simpler to talk about  - in a town, there is a male barber who shaves everyone who can\\'t shave their own beard. Does the barber shave his own beard?\\n\\nA legend named Bertrand Russell was frustrated, and blamed self-reference to be the cause of all the paradoxes(just like does the barber shaving himself?). So he along with his old mentor Alfred Whitehead, authored a book called *Principia Mathematica(PM)*, which contained strict rules to make any mathematical statements. Most importantly the rules prohibited self-reference. Nothing according to rules could refer to itself. They thought that with all these rules prohibiting self-reference, we would have no more contradictions in mathematics, and mathematicians can safely assume that every true statement of mathematics can be represented using the rules from the book. Apart from restricting self-reference, the other important aspect of the book was to make mathematics mechanical. \\n\\nThe book contained rules for how every statement in mathematics can be represented as a string of characters. And to derive a new theorem, all you have to do is start with a true statement, make string manipulations as per the rules of PM. For example, a rule can be if you see two $$\\\\neg$$ symbols side by side(\"$$\\\\neg$$\" stands for negation), they can be removed. This is logically equivalent of two NOs mean YES!\\n\\n$$ \\\\neg \\\\neg (2 + 2 = 4) $$\\n\\n$$ (2 + 2 = 4) $$\\n\\nIf you have followed the rules properly, you would end up at a new true statement in mathematics expressed in form of arbitrary characters. But note that the final arrived statement is not random, anyone with a basic training could decode what the set of characters were speaking. For example, look at the following string\\n\\n$$ \\\\neg \\\\exists b:(b.b)=SS0$$\\n\\nThe above states that there is no number that when multiplied by itself equals 2(We are dealing with natural numbers here). In short, it tells that 2 is not a perfect square. The two \"S\" in  `SS0` implies the successor of successor of 0, which is nothing but 2.(For convineince, you can think of `S` as adding 1. Adding 1 twice to zero, gives two) \\n\\nNow Russell has made a system so strong and rigorous that by following its rules, any true statement in mathematics about numbers can be written as a string of characters in PM; just like we did for \"2 is not a perfect square\". Using these rules, one can express any statement about numbers like \"23 is a prime\", \"every even number can be express as sum of two primes\", \"there are infinite prime numbers\". Russell was sure that with this set of rigorous rules  restricting self reference, there will be no paradoxes, no self referential statements. What Russell essentially did was he created a mapping between Statements about numbers in mathematics and string of characters.\\n\\nGodel came and re-analysed the notion of meaning of these strings of characters. He showed that by just adding another level of mapping, one could make self-referential statements. Put simply, just like Russell created a mapping between statements in mathematics and string of characters in PM, Godel created another mapping between strings of characters in PM and numbers. This second level of mapping - Godel\\'s numbering scheme is Godel\\'s first genius feat in the groundbreaking paper. \\n\\nThe second genius feat of Godel was using his numbering scheme, he was able to express a statement - *I am not provable* using the rules of PM(I would love to talk about the proof, but that will be a topic for another blog). Godel had not violated any rules. He just added another level of mapping, which could show that PM was strong enough not only to talk about numbers, but enough to speak about reasoning and itself. \\n\\nThus what Godel showed us is, with an enough complex system(like PM), self-reference is inevitable. Hofstadter argues that the same is human brain. So, the notion of *I* has inevitable risen from the complex repertoire of concepts in human mind.  \\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/hkWulR0.png)\\n\\nAnother important idea that is obscured here is how meaning arises from meaningless symbols. What Godel\\'s numbering scheme does is it creates a mapping between a statement about numbers and whole numbers. For example, consider a statement `0 = 0` has a Godel number of $$2^6 \\\\times 3^5 \\\\times 7^6$$.(Don\\'t worry about how it came, it is just a set of mechanical rules). Now whole numbers on their own don\\'t seem to contain any meaning. What can you make out from this huge number - $$2^6 \\\\times 3^5 \\\\times 7^6$$ ? But the mapping between meaningless Godel\\'s numbers and a statement in mathematics shows its importance. \\n\\nSimilarly, the firing patterns of neurons(activation of symbols) on their own might not seem to carry any meaning. Its just a physical process, what can one make out it? But they are essential in the sense that there is a mapping between those firing patterns of neurons and abstract concepts we perceive. A simpler analogy - individual marks on paper of different shapes like `c` or `o` are meaningless. It is aperiodic pattern of such different shapes that give rise to a meaningful sentence.\\n\\n## Revisiting \"I\"\\n\\n> Consciousness is not a power moonroof\\n\\nThis \"I\" concept is indispensable because of its survival value. We human beings are macroscopic creatures. We can\\'t look at things at a level of quarks and make decisions. There is a need for abstract concepts to make decisions important for our survival, and *I* is the most important one. You can\\'t escape the illusion of *I* because of your size. \\n\\nNow, there have been other arguments explaining, what I is and how consciousness arises. One of such arguments claims that there is something non-physical that comes on top of human brain that causes consciousness. But Hofstadter dismisses such arguments telling *consciousness is not a power moonroof*. He argues that it is not a feature built on top of brain. It is the complexity that inevitably gives to consciousness. Here is a good analogy given by Hofstadter. Suppose you want to build a Racecar. As per the design, you are building a car that has sixteen cylinder motor, its chassis has been built differently to endure high speeds, it has wider tyres. Now after building it, would you need to add some *race car power* to make it a race car? No, it is a race car due to its design. The same is with human brain. There is nothing like *the consciousness* layer, that is added to the physical human brain. The complex design of brain, which is capable of hosting a large variety of symbols, inevitably also has symbols to represent itself. \\n\\nNow again, one might argue that consciousness is due to some physical matter in human brain.  But this brings a lot of questions like what is special about this physical matter that causes this consciousness? where does it lie in our brain? is it only present in humans? why that matter is only in humans? \\n\\nQuoting Daniel Dennett - *It ain\\'t the meat, its the motion*.  It\\'s not about the physical matter the brain is made of, but it\\'s about the motions(patterns of neuronal firing) that inhabit the brain. \\n\\n## Human aspects\\n\\nOnce you consider this thought that what you perceive as *I* is an illusion caused by a set of particles following physics laws, it gives an existential crisis. But this existential crisis is good. Good in a sense that its implications liberate us from some of the regular sorrows, and change perception about different things about life.\\n\\nHopefully by now, you are convinced that *I* is a set of neuron firing patterns that run in one\\'s brain. The brain is just a platform or hardware or a host for these patterns.  Just like a book is not a physical thing - a set of papers bound together containing marks. A book is a pattern of characters. The pattern of characters can be hosted on paper, mobile screen, computer screen. Your identity is not your physical brain, but the patterns that run on it. So, in theory, a hardware built well that functions akin to brain, should be capable of simulating your thoughts. \\n\\nHofstadter calls the symbols capable of representing itself as called a *Strange Loop*. Each one of us has a strange loop representing himself/herself in our brains. The brain also houses many other symbols for various concepts. Among them, we also have symbols to represent people whom we meet. We can consider these symbols as a coarse copy of their strange loop. So, when you interact with your friend, who has her own strange loop. There is a coarse copy of her loop in your mind. The more you interact, the more you get to know each other, your copy of her strange loop gets more and more similar to her own strange loop. The same happens vice versa. Your friend has a coarse copy of your strange loop in her mind. And that coarse copy gets updated every time she gets to know more of you.\\n\\nThe interaction doesn\\'t have to be a conversation. You can know people via anecdotes that you have read or heard. You can also learn about people from their writings or their other works. This idea has profound implications. Especially, the idea that one can live longer even after physical death fascinates me the most. Fyodor Dostoevsky passed away a couple of centuries ago. But every time, when I read his works, my symbols for who Dostoevsky was, what his ideas were, what he felt all get transported destroying the physical barriers of space and time. I may not have met Douglas Hofstadter, but there are symbols in my brain representing him(his strange loop). And every time, I read his writings, my copy of his Strange loop starts getting identical to his own strange loop.\\n\\nSo, essentially one\\'s legacy left behind is one\\'s *soul shard*. Dostoevsky\\'s books, Chopin\\'s composition, Hemingway\\'s stories... all of these soul shards of these great men. And when we come across their works, we get to feel what they had felt. We get a glimpse of what it means to be that person. \\n\\nAnother of its implications is the realisation that identities are on a continuous spectrum. When a coarse copy of someone\\'s strange loop gets modified in your brain, it also modifies your own strange loop. This effect is more apparent in children, they imitate elders they interact with. We adults also kind of \"imitate\". When you spend time with your friend, you \"imitate\" her actions, that you like or you think are rewarding in your community. So, essentially the more time you spend with your friend, not only your coarse copy of her strange loop gets modified, but also your own strange loop gets more and more similar to hers. Perceptions become more and more similar. When you come across something that you have enjoyed, you also become aware of how that person will feel. That is how *we live in each other*. \\n\\nHere, I would like to show you a drawing of my good friend, representing the idea of we affect each other.\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/oaZshP1.png)  \\n\\n## Conscience and Consciousness\\n\\n> Partial internalisation of other creature\\'s interiority is what marks off creatures, who have large souls from creatures that have small souls\\n\\nNow that we have talked about consciousness, there is one more quality that is unique, fundamental to humans, lies closely to consciousness - Conscience.  In French, the word *conscience* has both meanings - conscience and consciousness. This is not a linguistic exception. If the ability of human brain to host patterns to represent itself cause consciousness,  then the ability of the same human brain to have coarse copies of fellow beings causes conscience. This enables us to be aware of what a person feels and sympathise with them, though we never have personally faced such a situation. \\n\\nOther creatures are not capable of this quality. Consider a mosquito. Due to its smaller brain size given by evolution, it is not capable of hosting a wide variety of symbols like human brain can host. So, there is no way for a mosquito to know what others perceive or feel or think. It can be considered as *blood-sucking flying automaton*. Hofstadter calls such creatures - *small sized souls*. The most interesting fact is we are somehow aware of this fact subconsciously. That is the reason why we don\\'t hesitate to kill a chicken as much as we hesitate to kill a dog or a fellow human being. In our subconscious, we have a built-in hierarchy cone according to the degree to which creatures can perceive themselves. It is based on this hierarchy, the decision on what creatures are to be consumed and what creatures are not is made.\\n\\n*The cone of consciousness*\\n\\n![](https://imgur.com/VNrIZW7.png)\\n\\nConscience and Consciousness are the qualities that makes humans unique. Gandhi was titled *Mahatma*, which in hindi means large sized soul- a soul that is capable of housing other souls. *Partial internalisation of other creature\\'s interiority is what marks off creatures, who have large souls from creatures that have small souls.* Sense of I is brought into reality with sense of other selves.\\n\\n## You are a Strange Loop\\n\\nThe question of consciousness, the question of I, all boil down to *who shoves whom around inside* our *teetering bulbs of dread and dream*. The fact, that we will never be able to perceive self at that level is a gift, for we live in abstract concepts of our own creation.\\n\\n## Interesting References mentioned in the book\\n\\nRelated to Philosophy of Minds\\n\\n- Reasons and Persons by Derek Parfit\\n- Mind\\'s I by Daniel Dannett and Hofstadter\\n- Intuition Pumps by Daniel Dannett\\n- Where am I by Daniel Dannett\\n\\nMovies & Novels\\n\\n- The Baker\\'s Wife\\n- The Catcher\\'s Rye\\n- The Heart is a lonely Hunter\\n- Sophia\\'s Choice\\n\\nShort Stories\\n\\n- Pig by Roald Dahl\\n- An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge by Ambrose Bierce\\n\\nPhrases\\n\\n- *Teetering Bulb of Dread and Dream* from a Russell Edson\\'s poem named The Floor\\n- *Who shoves whom around inside the cranium* from Roger Sperry\\n- *blooming, buzzing confusions* - baby\\'s first experience of the world.

      "\n",
      "This book was hard to read. At many places, it is wordy and vague. Online forums  were [Jagurutu](http://www.jacurutu.com/index.php?sid=6960afbf721ee245f1fc5b27530f224e) were a great aid. I am still frustrated by the fact that fantasy elements like *prescience* have played a major role in key parts of a **\"sci-fi\"** book. Yet, I will continue with the next part because I have more questions that   haven't been answered. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Why we die by Venki Ramakrishnan\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked this book because I loved Venki's first book- The Gene Machine. This book repeatedly proves the point that a good writing on an unfamiliar topic is much more enjoyable bad writing on a exciting topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book can be considered as a crash course in cell biology. The author explains different causes of aging and death at the level of activities that go wrong within a cell - accumulation of waste, too many misfolded proteins, DNA damage etc. Even though you are not enthusiastic about biological details, Venki's writing spurs great interest. I believe it is due to these 2 pedagogical techiques:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) Explaining from a historical perspective. Venki doesn't just drop you that this fact about cell exists and was discovered by so and so scientist. He walks through all the key discoveries in chronological order that led to it. This narrative helps narrator think about the ideas in a more organised way. This should be a lesson taught to every teacher - find a way to put ideas in the students' head in a organised way instead of shooting with facts. (But a more fundamental reason for many bad teachers is not that this a secret they are yet to discover, but because they themselves lack clarity in the subject)\n",
      "\n",
      "b) Einstein once said \"*Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler*\". Once Venki explains a point. He adds a couple of sentences more to emphasise the important point. He sometimes simplifies it, for example, \"improve life expectancy faster than age\" is followed by \"life expectancy increases by more than year annually.\" Or he puts a useful analogy to daily life objects.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the above, Venki makes the last but one paragraph of each chapter as a concise summary of the present chapter and the last paragraph gives you an direction of next chapter. Each chapter begins with small personal story    before embarking on complex cellular details discussion. Such good writing preserves the human side of details filled science. \n",
      "\n",
      "[Chris Olah once mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzJigelnRBE) that reason there is friction that complex ideas are difficult to communicate from writer to the reader is that in his/her working memory, the writer has the context set, which the reader lacks. Good writers realise this cognitive load and they try to make the road smoother for reader instead of diverting them to a messy shortcut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another quality that makes this book qualify as an good book is provides a new perspective for an outsider in the field. As you read along, one develops a perspective of how processes inside the tiny cell has consequences for what we see and experience as ageing(Douglas Hofstadter provides such a perspective on about consciousness and neurons). Irrespective of your interest in biology, if you enjoy good writing and have an interesting understanding details of life, pick this book.\n",

      "## Dune by Frank Herbert\n",
      "\n",
      "Picked this book after watching the movies(Part-1,2) and this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26GPaMoeiu4), where Herbert tells that his book tries to convey a message about the dangers of charismatic leaders. As I read the book, I felt great appreciation for Denis V. for cutting down parts and making necessary changes to adapt the book for the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the book is labelled as science fiction, the aspect of \"prescience\" makes it feel like a fantasy book which I avoid. However, it seems that Herbert was inspired by the idea of Laplace's demon - a creature that knew everything about individual atoms and physical laws and hence could calculate the future. At one point, I convinced myself that Spice could heighten abilities like making such absurd amount of computation in human beings that have evolved after thousands of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading a book after watching the movie suppress the thrill because you already know what is going to happen(\"*prescience*\"). Nevertheless, I had to read this book to read the next part so that I get the interesting message that Herbert wanted to convey.\n",

      "\n",
      "An interesting topic for people in psychology is \"altered state of mind.\" Accounts of it in diseased states are explored well in Oliver Sacks' *Hallucinations*. Aldous Huxley's *Doors of Perception* is one of the best personal accounts of achieving an altered state through a substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this book, Pollan covers the literature of Psychedelics in all 3 aspects - historic, scientific, personal accounts. In historical part, he discusses different psychedelic substances were discovered, how scientists saw the potential to cure mental health diseases or over death anxiety in terminally ill patients with these, how some people saw it as a way to unlock human potential and elevate human society. Lastly, how one man(Timothy Leary) could be held responsible for these substances becoming anti-culture. A laudable thing about Pollan is that his writing covers different aspects of an argument(like it was not Leary's fault completely!). \n",
      "\n",
      "In the scientific part, Pollan explores the neural correlates of psychedelics' famous effect  ego-death. The other fascinating part of this book is author's personal trips on different substances. In each of his trip, he sees his family emotions amplified and you come across funny things like watching the hollow mask illusion while high.\n",

      "The reading experience would have been much more fun if I wasn't aware of the best parts of the book like planet's destruction, 42 and Heart of Gold. A short book worth reading. A couple of disappointments - a)at places, complex sci-fi words were used without much explanation b)I feel there are jokes in the book require a peculiar thought process to understand them. Such jokes are hard to appreciate without any hint given to the reader.

James Gleick captures one such narrative in his book \"Chaos\", chronicling the  evolution of Non-Linear dynamics. Genius Makers by Cade Metz is another such book. A book about the rise of AI, more specifically deep learning.

      "While the first half of this book has many bold ideas, I found myself sceptical of them as they lacked experimental evidence. Although Jeff and his colleagues have produced journal papers to support their work, those papers provide a computational model built on basis of their ideas. I am not against computational model work, but with a play of parameters and many assumptions can lead to a model that aligns with researcher's expectations but not objective reality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that a genuine testament to a theory's validity lies either in experimental evidence or its tangible application. A good example of the latter is ChatGPT. You don't need any benchmark tests to show that the billion parameter model is good. People buy it and use it in their day-to-day life because it adds value. It is useful!. In Ilya Sutskever's works, *usefulness is the best metric*.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter half of the book contains interesting futuristic discussions about preserving human knowledge and extraterrestrial communication. Hawkins suggests some new ideas humans might convey a message in space, that other forms of life can decipher. While I came for the brain theories, I liked this part of the book!\n",

      "## Double by Fyodor Dostoevsky\n",
      "\n",
      "A short story written by Dostoevsky three years before his exile. While I have always been an admirer of Dostoevsky's work, I didn't enjoy this one. The events surround protagonist's double and story's conclusion were hard to reconcile. The writing style contrasts from his other popular works like Notes from Underground, where Dostoevsky masterfully dissects a man's thoughts. I felt 'The Double' lacked that. Maybe this one requires a re-reading to get a clearer perspective, but I feel like revisiting \"Notes from underground\" to experience the Dostoevsky I cherish.  \n",

      "## Gene Machine by Venki Ramakrishnan\n",
      "\n",
      "The book chronicles the journey of Venki Ramakrishnan from a graduate student in theoretical physics to a Nobel Prize-winning Ribosome structural biologist. This book is an essential reading for anyone involved in research for two  reasons. Firstly, it offers valuable insights into the inner workings of effective scientific research, including the work culture at MRC London Institute (home to 12 Nobel laureates, including Watson and Crick), the significance of an enthusiastic work environment, and how top researchers select their problems to work on, as well as the role of luck. Secondly, as a personal account of Ramakrishnan's journey, the book exposes the insecurities that even the best researchers face, making it relatable and reassuring for others in the field. Although the book contains substantial structural biology content, readers from diverse backgrounds will still be able to appreciate and enjoy the narrative.\n",

      "## Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always been captivated by the diverse experiences that the human brain can generate, and this book offers a plethora of such instances. On a personal level, this book has reinforced my belief that ultimately the underlying physiology dictates an individualâ€™s experiences and behaviours.

      "## The Elephant in the Brain by Simler and Hanson\n",
      "\n",
      "This book can be summarized with the quote - *A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and a real reason.* The book talks about the hidden motives behind our actions. Hidden motives as in not just unknown to other people, but also to you(your consciousness). Through evolution, our brains have learnt to deceive ourselves before deceiving others. This is perfect for survival because if you are unaware of it, then you won't express it and your real selfish motive will remain hidden. Any Freud fan would surely be attracted to such an idea that explores the unconscious side of the brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "This first part of this book does a great job in explaining how such a self-deception came into existence and why it is necessary for survival. The second part of the book explore implications of this idea in large scale institutions like Education, Politics, Religion, Medicine, Art. The book uncovers the hidden motives by showing the discrepancy between the apparent intention and action. These discussions are also backed by evolutionary arguments and experiments on animals. I was really impressed by this aspect of the book. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is an interesting book explaining one of the less explored aspects of human nature. Reading this might help to highten your self-perception. \n",

      "## The Trial by Franz Kafka\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being unfinished, Kafka's novels have a great popularity. To understand the true legacy of Kafka, I picked up this book(this is my 3rd Kafka book. After Metamorphosis and Amerika). A sense of guilt still haunts me for not having understood Kafka's celebrated genius in all of his books. The book has a good start, but over time, I felt chapters ended abruptly and many scenes were unnecessary. May be it requires more patience, skill and literary intelligence to appreciate Kafka and his work.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## Black Swan by N. N. Taleb\n",
      "\n",
      "A wonderful reading experience! The book deals with randomness and human perception of it. One can find many good discussions on broad range of topics(yet related to central theme of the book) like human bias, career advice, philosophy, baloney, Gaussian curve. The most important effect of this book is that it tries to make the reader aware of one's own limitations(***anti-library,narrative fallacy,ludic fallacy,epistemic arrogance, Popper's disproving, effect of the unseen, GIF, Locke's madman, END(Evidence of No Disease) and NED(No Evidence of Disease), mediocristan vs extremistan*** ) and teaches to accept the key role of uncertainty(***Black swans***) and if possible try to take advantage of it(***barbell strategy, Appelles the painter,stochastic tinkering, practitioner, empiricist***). \n",
      "\n",
      "Many words marked in bold are the things that will hit you hard when you read the book.\n",

      "## The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\n",
      "\n",
      "An important take away for me from the book is with discipline and meticulous planning, how one can improve one's character(chapter - Plan for attaining Moral Perfection). I picked up this book when I came across Franklin's efforts to improve his elegance in writing, mentioned in the book Peak(one of the most important Psychology books in my opinion).  At places, some witty insights like these are enjoyable\n",
      "\n",
      "> A  man being sometimes more generous when he has but little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro' fear of being  thought to have little.\n",
      "\n",
      ">  So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do\n",
      "\n",
      "> a benevolent man should allow a few defaults in himself to keep his friends in countenance\n",
      "\n",
      "> Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happened, as by little advantages that occur every day\n",
      "\n",
      "For someone super organized like Franklin, no doubt that having small things in order leaves a room for lot of time and cognitive space to do more important things. But I confess that at times, I skimmed over parts where too many details of anecdotes were mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "##  The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins\n",
      "\n",
      "The book's main aim is to explain evolution of life from Gene's perspective.  Personally, the most impactful parts of the book were where Dawkins explains how several aspects of animal behaviour like preference for relatives over others, males' efforts to attract females arise from  genes acting in their selfish interest. On reflection, this makes us feel how strongly evolutionary wiring influences our daily actions and decisions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, the book also points out that only we humans are capable of acting against our evolutionary hard wiring. Evolution by giving rise to consciousness in humans made a machine(human), which could understand how it was built. Humans using a contraceptive is an example of an action against the gene's dictatorship. \n",
      "\n",
      "> We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators\n",
      "\n",
      "The chapter on Memes(Mimeme, unit of cultural transmission) explains evolution of life from a cultural perspective. A thought-provoking explanation for questions like why traditions exist?,  how are they passed on from generation to generation?, why some traditions last so long? Somehow the book has left me with the impression that with proper usage of Gene's and/or Meme's point of view, one could explain the reason behind every single human action.\n",
      "\n",
      "At several places in the book, well-written lines force the reader to pause and ponder its implications in one's own life. When you pick up the book, give the longest pause when you see the below lines.  \n",
      "\n",
      "> .... When we die there  are two things we can leave behind us: genes and memes. We were built as gene machines, created to  pass on our genes. But that aspect of us will be forgotten in three generations. Your child, even your  grandchild, may bear a resemblance to you, perhaps in facial features, in a talent for music, in the colour of her hair. But as each generation passes, the contribution of your genes is halved. It does not take long  to reach negligible proportions. Our genes may be immortal but the collection of genes that is any one of  us is bound to crumble away. Elizabeth II is a direct descendant of William the Conqueror. Yet it is quite  probable that she bears not a single one of the old king's genes. \n",
      ">\n",
      "> **We should not seek immortality in  reproduction**.  But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking  plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool.  **Socrates may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today, as G. C. Williams has remarked,  but who cares? The meme-complexes of Socrates, Leonardo, Copernicus and Marconi are still going  strong**.\n",

      "## Life Lessons From Freud by Brett Kahr\n",
      "\n",
      "Picked this book because \"Freud\" was in the title.  Essays where some of the interesting Freud's ideas are discussed - relation of filial piety and complacency, Freudian Slips, Freud's respect for patients' privacy, affect of past on the unconscious mind, Freud's theories on jokes and narcissism.  A good book to get introduced to some of Freud's ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Slaughterhouse 5: The Children's Crusade by Kurt Vonnegut\n",
      "\n",
      "Things that I loved about this book  - interesting non-linear story narration, neat writing style with lack of pomp and most importantly philosophical lessons about freewill by Tralfamadorians(an alien species).  A classic book that every literature enthusiast ought to read. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Amerika by Franz Kafka\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a Kafka's unfinished novel. I picked up this book with a hope that I might recognize Kafka's genius elements at least in this book. To my disappointment, I could not.  I admit that I dragged myself hard to finish this novel. But it was a good read. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka\n",
      "\n",
      "Kafka though never achieved fame during his lifetime continued to write(the works that made Kafka popular are published after his death).  This, I felt is a true sign of love for writing. Hence I started picking up Kafka's books.  Metamorphosis is a short and good read with a simple writing style.  I confess that I couldn't grasp the genius elements of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley\n",
      "\n",
      "Huxley is a writer with a deadly combination of Scientific knowledge and literary talents. After reading the essay, the reader is forced to think about the question - *do my everyday perception of the outer world reflect reality?*. Our brain filters a lot of sensory inputs as a lot of it is unnecessary for survival purpose. What would happen if you could somehow inhibit the filter in the brain and look at things as they are -**Ding an Sich**. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Essays by Orwell\n",
      "\n",
      "Having read 1984 and Animal Farm, it is difficult to not to be mesmerized by Orwell's simple yet powerful style of writing. The lack of pretense and urge to convey an idea is evident in his essays. Here are the list of the essays that you will enjoy\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Why I write\n",
      "2. Good Bad Books\n",
      "3. English and Political Language\n",
      "4. Shooting an Elephant\n",

      "7. Confessions of a Book Reviewer\n",
      "8. Books vs Cigarettes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Animal Farm by George Orwell\n",
      "\n",
      "The true genius of Orwell lies in the fact that this book can be read by anyone regardless of age and background and still get the core message - revolution that caused shifting of power from oppressor to oppressed might not necessarily improve conditions; power can corrupt the ideals. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Why don't Students like School by Daniel T. Willingham\n",
      "\n",
      "An excellent book about cognition of learning. Every teacher should be given a physical copy of the book and asked to read it atleast twice. The book not only explains learning from psychological perspective but also provides practical advice in bringing psychological findings into practice.\n",
